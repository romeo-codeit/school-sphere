by NWAMARIFE PATRICK (OHMAN)

Are you aspiring to gain admission into a higher institution in Nigeria someday? Or have you participated in the recent UTME (JAMB) examination? INDEED, YOU CANNOT SECURE ADMISSION INTO ANY HIGHER INSTITUTION IN NIGERIA WITHOUT THE PRINCIPLES I AM ABOUT TO SHARE. I need to emphasize that there is significantly more to gaining admission than merely sitting for the JAMB examination. If you lack firsthand information about the admission process at your institution of choice, I implore you to pay close attention until the conclusion of this discourse.. 
My name is NWAMARIFE PATRICK, also known as SIR OHMAN. I am an educationist and a medical professional, and I am passionate about empowering young individuals to realize their life goals and aspirations.

I have categorized this ADMISSION Guide into five distinct sections to enable you to maximize this learning opportunity:
1. PRE-UTME PRINCIPLES 
2. ON-UTME PRINCIPLES 
3. POST-EXAMINATION EXERCISES
4. ADMISSION WITHOUT UTME 
5. STUDY ABROAD

PRE-UTME PRINCIPLES INCLUDE:
i. Correct O’level Result
The first step towards getting admission in Nigerian is to attain a Commendable O’level Result. Achieving success in your WAEC or NECO examinations is imperative for gaining admission to Nigerian universities. Every institution in Nigeria mandates that you possess a minimum of five (5) credits in relevant subjects. For instance, to pursue Radiography at the University, you must secure at least credit passes in the following subjects:- Mathematics- English Language- Biology- Chemistry and Physics. Please note: Failure to possess the appropriate O’level qualifications may result in disqualification from admission. Some institutions utilize O’level results for Post-JAMB screening. If your results contain C grades, you may encounter difficulties in securing admission. 
You are permitted to combine two O’level results for admission purposes in Nigeria. For example, you may utilize results from two sittings or amalgamate WAEC and NECO results. However, for prestigious courses such as Medicine and Surgery, the combination of O’level results is prohibited; candidates may only utilize one sitting of either NECO or WAEC. If you are yet to undertake your SSCE WAEC or NECO examinations, I encourage you to prepare diligently to achieve an excellent result, as the optimal time to commence your SSCE preparation is in SS1. Your WASSCE questions will encompass content from SS1 through SS3. In certain institutions, achieving 'A' grades in your O’level examinations provides an additional advantage during the Post-JAMB screening.
 ii. Select a Course that Resonates with Your Passion
It is essential to possess a genuine passion for the course you wish to pursue in higher education. Passion is the driving force that propels you to excel and attain success. Many students grapple with the challenge of identifying their passion due to a limited understanding of how the university system operates. Law, Medicine, and Mass Communication are not the sole pathways available to you. Numerous other exceptional courses exist within higher education. My counsel is to dedicate time to self-discovery; only you can uncover your true passion. Avoid the pitfall of conforming to the crowd; just because your friends have applied for Engineering does not necessitate that you must follow suit. Pursuing a course that does not align with your passion may lead to frustration. The best way to ascertain the course that suits you is to conduct thorough research online.
Iii. Pay Attention to Your Academic Prowess. 
In addition to passion, it is crucial to possess the academic prowess requisite for the course you aspire to study. Having a passion for a course is one thing; meeting the academic criteria for the program at the university is another. To study Law, for instance, you must attain a high score that surpasses the cut-off mark. The reality is that not every student can achieve the required cut-off score for their desired course. At this juncture, you have two options to consider:1. Forego this year's admission and return to study diligently for the next UTME or accept admission into a related course that aligned with your aspirations. Regardless of the decision you make, remain true to yourself. Oftentimes, you may need to compromise and settle for something adjacent to your dream course. 
I.v Identify and Understand Your Academic Strengths and Weaknesses
Recognizing your academic strengths and weaknesses will significantly enhance your chances of securing admission. You must elevate your performance by studying diligently. Do not shy away from your weaknesses; instead, identify subjects in which you excel and pursue a course that encompasses those subjects.
V. Choose the Appropriate University in Your JAMB Application
Selecting the right university is paramount to your admission success. Various institutions have Post-JAMB screening policies that may not favor your application. Consider factors such as ELDA, ADMISSION BY MERIT, and CATCHMENT AREA, as they play crucial roles in the admission process.ON-UTME PRINCIPLES Prepare, Excel, and Achieve a High Score in JAMBThorough preparation and successful completion of your JAMB examination is the pathway to gaining admission in Nigeria. The fundamental principle is straightforward: the higher your JAMB score, the greater your chances of securing admission. I implore you to strive for an impressive JAMB score. To achieve a high score, familiarize yourself with strategies such as:- Allotting time for each question- Beginning with subjects you find most familiar- Maintaining a healthy mental and emotional state- Adhering to examination protocols

POST–EXAMINATION ACTIVITIES
I. Examine Your Course Competitors
Investigate through reliable sources the number of candidates who selected your intended course at your chosen institution and their score ranges to ascertain your admission prospects. JAMB typically allows CBT centers to provide UTME statistics, which you can leverage to gauge how many candidates are vying for the same admission slot as you.Consider Changing Your Course/InstitutionCertain institutions and courses attract more applicants than others, leading to heightened competition. This is why it is vital to familiarize yourself with the cut-off marks for your intended course and the number of candidates who scored above these marks to determine whether a change of course or institution is warranted. If you discover that your chances of admission are slim, consider switching to a less competitive course or institution.Link Your Email to JAMB CapsLinking your email is an essential step that keeps you connected to the board. By linking your email to JAMB, you can access your JAMB Portal via your smartphone or other personal devices. Currently, the process of linking your email can only be completed at an accredited center or designated locations. At these centers, you will receive a login password to access your JAMB profile. If you have yet to link your email account, I encourage you to visit any JAMB office or nearby CBT center. If you are in Onitsha, you may visit INVENTORS CORNER at #15 ANAZONWU STREET OFF TOTAL FILLING STATION ALONG UPPER NEW MARKET ONITSHA or SUSU SCHOOL OF ADVANCED STUDIES AT #70 Ozomagala Street by AFUBERA for further assistance.
I. UPLOAD YOUR O’LEVEL RESULTS Do not delude yourself into thinking that merely filling in your WAEC result in the pre-registration form suffices before biometric capture. Ensure that you have uploaded your O’level results to the board, as this is a prerequisite for gaining admission (you can verify this through your phone after the upload).
Ii. EXPLORE ONLINE RESOURCES
Regularly check the official website of your institution of choice for pertinent admission information. Details regarding post-UTME screening, academic calendars, and other critical events and requirements are likely available on the school’s website.APPLY FOR POST-UTMEIn some institutions, it is mandatory for students to submit an official application via the school’s website regarding post-UTME; failure to do so may result in the inability to secure admission. Therefore, ensure that you register for post-UTME and consistently monitor your CAPS at https://efacility.jamb.gov.ng/Login to track your admission progress. The Post-UTME examination poses a significant challenge for some students. Even after achieving a high score, certain candidates may still not gain admission due to a low JAMB score. It is imperative to master the techniques necessary to excel in the Post-UTME examination.Create a JAMB Profile Your JAMB Profile serves as a comprehensive account of all the information you provided during JAMB registration, including your First and Second Choice Schools and JAMB Subject Combination. This profile also encompasses your Profile code and Bio-data, such as your Name, Gender, and Local Government of Origin. Establishing this profile is a critical step in registering for JAMB.Once you have completed your registration with the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), your JAMB Profile account becomes your primary point of contact with the organization. While JAMB registration centers may have assisted with your registration, you will not need to visit them again unless you require changes to your course or institution, subject combination, or need to retake the JAMB examination. However, most tasks such as accepting or rejecting admission offers, checking admission status, printing JAMB original results, and accessing JAMB indemnity forms can be accomplished through your JAMB Profile. 
To access your JAMB Profile, visit the JAMB efacility page and log in using your registered email address and password.Upon logging in, you will be directed to the home screen of your JAMB Profile efacility page. This is where you can access a variety of features and tools related to your JAMB registration and admission process.5. Pray earnestly for your admission to be granted over your peers.ADMISSION WITHOUT UTMEWhile the UTME (JAMB) examination is undoubtedly the most prevalent method for securing university admission, it is by no means the only avenue available. You can gain admission through the following alternatives:- IJMB (Interim Joint Matriculation Board Examination)- JUPEB- Pre-Degree/Pre-Science Programs- Nursing Entrance ExaminationIJMB	
IJMB is a prestigious examination body for educational advancement, facilitating students in securing direct admission into the second year (200 level) in various universities within Nigeria and abroad.

Many who achieve scores above 200 in the UTME still struggle to gain admission. Notably, the UTME results are valid for only one year, whereas IJMB results have no expiration date.The IJMB program mirrors JUPEB, and successful candidates at the conclusion of the program can gain entry into the second year.
