    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "A. He bit off people's jaws:\u00a0\u00a0This option is not the answer because it takes the expression \"jawing away\" too literally. In this context, \"jawing away\" is an informal phrase that means talking or chatting continuously, not physically biting off people's jaws.\nB. He was always chewing in the class: This option is incorrect because it misinterprets the meaning of \"jawing away.\" The phrase refers to talking or chatting, not chewing.\nC. He was always making trouble for the class: This option is not the answer because while \"jawing away\" might imply being talkative, it doesn't necessarily mean causing trouble. It's more about continuous talking or chatter.\nD. He talked continuously in the class.- This option is correct because it accurately captures the meaning of \"jawing away\" in this context. The sentence indicates that the new boy talked a lot in class, causing the class to become tired of it. So, option D is the best explanation for the information conveyed in the sentence.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The\u00a0phrase \"angry with\" is the correct usage. This phrase is used to indicate the emotion of anger directed towards a specific person or entity. In this case, the speaker is expressing anger towards Oche specifically because of their differing opinions. On the other hand, \"angry about\" could also be used in certain contexts, such as \"I was angry about his behaviour,\" where the anger is directed towards a situation or event rather than a specific person.\nThe phrase\u00a0\"differed with\" is the correct usage to indicate that you have contrasting opinions with someone else. \"With\". \"differed from\" is used to indicate the difference between objects and ideas and does now show that someone has differing opinions from someone else.\nTherefore, option D, \"with / with,\" is the correct choice.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "explanation": "stressed syllables are the syllables within a word that have the most emphasis when spoken.for example:other- the syllable\"oth\" is stressed and the syllable\"er\"is not because\"er\"is pronounced less that\"oth\"the\"er\"tends to sound as if it were falling away at the end of the word.compound words;tend to be double stressed because both syllables are pronounced equallyfor examplechildhood- both \"child\" and \"hood\" are pronounced fullyyou can tell which syllable is stressed by saying the word naturallyIn words of two syllables or more, at least one of the syllables is usually pronounced with extra emphasis. We can divide syllables into stressed and unstressed categories.\nimpound; (words with prefix are usually stressed on the second syllable) this would be stressed as imPOUND\nsubject(verb);as a verb is stressed thus subJECT\ncanoe;is stressed on the second syllable as caNOE\nknowledge;is a compound word made up of two different words ''know and ledge''. it is therefore stressed on the first syllable as KNOWledge\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

For questions on emphatic stress, the goal is to look for the question that contradicts the stressed word or phrase in the utterance. The utterance, in this context, is trying to clarify that the mother \"can\" actually cook the meal.
