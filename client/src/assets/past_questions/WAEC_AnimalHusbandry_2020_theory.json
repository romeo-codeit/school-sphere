    "correct_answer": "(a) Explanation of Mating Methods in Farm Animal:\n(i) Hand mating - It is a mating method in which the farmer identifies the female on heat and bring it together with the male for mating.\n(ii) Pen mating - In this method. a group of male and female animals are kept together in an acceptable ratio for mating in the same pen/ enclosure.\n(iii) Pasture mating - This is a mating method in which male and female animals are allowed to run together and mate freely/female animals on heat\u00a0are mated by any of the males in the group.\n(b)i) Advantages of Mating Methods:\n(1) Hand mating:\nThe line of offspring can easily be identified hence records can also be adequately kept.Indiscriminate mating is prevented/mating can be scheduled.It can prevent inbreeding.The frequency of use of male can be regulated.Desired characteristics can be preserved.It is possible to calculate the probable date of parturition.\n(2) Pen mating:\nIt required less labour.Does not need experienced handlers.Female animals are more aroused and receptiveDegree of successful mating is high.Cost of keeping animals is low.\n(3) Pasture mating:\nConception rate is higher because the chances of missing heat is lower.Requires low labour input.Low housing cost since male and female animals are housed together.Females on heat are easily detected by the malesAggressive and high libido males can easily be identified.Animals have access to regular exercise.\n(ii) Disadvantages of Mating Methods:\n(1) Hand mating:\nIt requires experienced handlers to detect heat.The cost of keeping male and female animals separately is high.Requires more labour.Heat may go undetected.Male and female animals may reject each other resulting in unsuccessful breeding.\n(2) Pen mating:\nRecord keeping is difficult.Competition could occur among males leading to injury/death.The males may be overworked and easily exhausted.The sire may not be known.Mating may not occur due to male competition.0ver mating of females may occur leading to bleeding/injury/death.\n(3) Pasture mating:\nIt may be difficult to identify the sireCompetition among males may lead to injury of males.Record keeping is difficult.Competition among males could lead to failed mating.Over mating of females can lead to bleeding/injury/death.\n(c) Methods of Semen Collection from Bull:\nUse of dummy/teaser.Use of artificial vagina.Use of electro-ejaculator/electrical ejaculation.Use of hand massage.",
