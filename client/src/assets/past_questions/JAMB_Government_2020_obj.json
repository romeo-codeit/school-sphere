    "explanation": "The United States of America refused to license the sales of arms to the federal government, as a result,\u00a0Nigerians were reluctant to interact with USA and turned\u00a0to the Soviet\u00a0Union who supplied the federal government arms.\nDuring Nigeria's First Republic (1960-1966), the country's foreign policy was influenced by both international dynamics and domestic considerations. The Cold War era significantly influenced international relations. Nigeria, newly independent and seeking to establish itself, was navigating the global pressures of aligning with either Western or Eastern blocs. The U.S. and the Soviet Union were the principal superpowers, and their competition often influenced the foreign policies of smaller nations.\nDuring the early years of Nigeria's independence, the U.S. was hesitant to supply arms to Nigeria. This reluctance was partly due to concerns over the stability of the Nigerian government and the potential for arms to be used in internal conflicts or to destabilise the region further. The U.S. was cautious about providing military support to nations in unstable regions, especially when there were concerns about political and military reliability.\nFaced with difficulties in securing arms and military support from the U.S., Nigeria began to look for alternatives. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, was willing to provide military assistance and arms to newly independent African nations as part of its broader strategy to expand its influence in Africa and counter Western dominance. This led Nigeria to strengthen its relations with the Soviet Union, particularly in terms of military equipment and support.\nNigeria's relationship with the U.S. during this period was characterised by cautious diplomacy. While Nigeria was open to engaging with Western nations, including the U.S., the perceived lack of support and assistance made it turn towards the Soviet Union for immediate needs. This shift was also a strategic move to diversify Nigeria's international alliances and strengthen its position in global affairs.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "explanation": "The Gulf War of 1990-1991, triggered by Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait highlighted\u00a0several challenges faced by the United Nations in maintaining global peace and security. Despite diplomatic efforts, the U.N. was unable to prevent Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The invasion occurred despite the presence of international norms and resolutions aimed at maintaining peace and security. While the U.N. Security Council did pass resolutions condemning the invasion and imposing sanctions, the enforcement of these resolutions required intervention by a coalition led by the United States. The U.N. lacked the means to directly enforce its decisions without the support of member states.\nThe Cold War context and the interests of major powers often influence U.N. decisions. During the Gulf War, the strategic interests of the U.S. and its allies played a significant role in shaping the response, rather than solely the U.N.'s objectives. Also, The U.N.'s role in the Gulf War was primarily focused on immediate conflict resolution and did not address the underlying issues that could lead to lasting peace. The conflict was resolved through military intervention and temporary measures rather than long-term solutions for regional stability.\nDespite the resolution of the Gulf War, the region continued to experience instability and conflict. This ongoing unrest illustrates the difficulty the U.N. faces in achieving and maintaining permanent world peace.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
