Allegory generally operates on two levels as a literary device.

However, the emphasis of allegory is typically placed on the abstract ideals represented or symbolized by the work's literary elements. In other words, the meaning behind the surface narrative has even greater value as a literary work. Though many allegories are intended to be didactic in providing a moral, ethical, or religious lesson, not all allegories set out to achieve this goal.",
