    "correct_answer": "Discuss the relationship between Nii Kpakpo and Maa Tsuru in the novel. Nii Kpakpo is Maa Tsuru's second `husband'. As is the case with Kwei who fathers her four eldest children, Nii Kpakpo and Maa Tsuru are not really married; they are merely cohabiting. She meets him after Kwei has abandoned her and her children. There is no evidence in the novel that Nii Kpakpo loves Maa Tsuru. His main goal in the relationship appears to be to sponge on her and make himself as comfortable as he can. Nii Kpakpo has a tremendous influence on Maa Tsuru's household as later events are to show. The way in which he worms himself into Maa Tsuru's affections exposes him as a scheming and heartless fraud. He is able to endear himself to her through an elaborately his being out of a job as a consequence of renovation being carried out on aluminum factory in Tema.He is testing the ground. He soon realizes how gullible Mas Tsuru is. Though she has not heard of the factory before, she believes Nii Kpakpo's story. This first victory boosts Nii Kpakpo's confidence. Next, he makes it a habit to visit Maa Tsuru's home at lunch time so that his afternoon meal is assured. He puts off her requests to visit his home under the pretext that his \"people\" will not welcome her because of the curse on Maa Tsuru's head. Then, growing in confidence, he suggests after heavy drinking and a hefty meal, that he moves in with her because as he claims, \"I miss sharing the same bed with you at night\".\nTotally enamoured of this man who appears to her to be restoring her self-esteem, dented by her disastrous relationship with Kwei, she gratefully invites him into her one-bedroom home. Nii Kpakpo's very first night in Maa Tsuru's home presages the destabilizing effect which he will have on the household. On the morning after a night-long bout of love-making in full view of the children, the two eldest children of Maa Tsuru, the boys, leave home, never to return. With them disappears Maa Tsuru's source of income for the sustenance of her family. This causes untold suffering to Maa Tsuru and her two remaining children. Added to this burden is that she has one more mouth to feed - an adult mouth at that! She begins to worry and cannot even sleep at night. Maa Tsuru is `blind' to Nii Kpakpo's misdemeanours. Even after she learns the truth about the non-existent job in Tema and the fraud which he perpetrates on prospective tenants for his one room in his family house, she does not take any action. Everyone expects she will, but quite naively she keeps allowing him to exploit her. Soon Maa Tsuru is carrying Kpakpo's child. Nii Kpakpo's exploitation of Maa Tsuru further manifests itself in his sexual abuse of her daughter, Baby T. even then, Maa Tsuru does not react.\nHis exploitation culminates in his facilitation of Ba by T's sale to Maame Broni. He deceives Maa Tsuru into believing that Baby t's is going away to serve as househelp to some rich person. His influence over Maa Tsuru is such that whatever he suggests is readily acceptable to her and makes sense. Eventually Baby T is brutally murdered.

Fofo. the younger sister, soon leaves home, realizing that there is no possibility of a meaningful relationship with her mother as long as Nii Kpakpo is around. He thus serves as the knife which servers family relationships. In conclusion, the relationship between Nii Kpakpo anc Maa Tsuru is one between the exploiter, Nii Kpakpo, anc the exploited, Maa Tsuru: In the end, he abandons Maa\u00a0Tsuru, having fathered two boys with her, thus renewing her fate as a single parent.\nPoints to note;\n(a) They are not husband and wife in the traditional sense.\n(b) Nii Kpakpo exploits Maa Tsuru's desire to have `a husband'\n(c) Maa Tsuru's gullibility makes the man more confident to move in to live with her.\n(d) His presence in the house causes the departure of Maa Tsuru's four children to live in the streets.\n(e) Nii Kpakpo finally leaves Maa Tsuru worse off.",

    "correct_answer": "What is Max's attitude towards racial relations, in the novel? Max is a legal practitioner of repute. He is clearly dis-satisfied with American society. He does not favour the subjugation of minority groups in the Union. This attitude may explain his joining the communist Party and the Labour Defenders.\nWhether Max's joining the communist Party is a means of personal escape or an avenue for political achieve-ment, Max takes exception to the racial relations. Max knows all about the black situation. As he points out to Bigger in prison, the whole black race, including other minorities, and its structures are kept together and alive only by faith. Losing that adhesive causes the collaspse of any ideals that the blacks. This is why Max urges Bigger, even at the point when Bigger is headed for the electric chair, to be staunch in his belief in him-self.For Max, it is unacceptable to regard any human being as second rate or deny him opportunities.

    "explanation": "What is Max's attitude towards racial relations, in the novel? Max is a legal practitioner of repute. He is clearly dis-satisfied with American society. He does not favour the subjugation of minority groups in the Union. This attitude may explain his joining the communist Party and the Labour Defenders.\nWhether Max's joining the communist Party is a means of personal escape or an avenue for political achieve-ment, Max takes exception to the racial relations. Max knows all about the black situation. As he points out to Bigger in prison, the whole black race, including other minorities, and its structures are kept together and alive only by faith. Losing that adhesive causes the collaspse of any ideals that the blacks. This is why Max urges Bigger, even at the point when Bigger is headed for the electric chair, to be staunch in his belief in him-self.For Max, it is unacceptable to regard any human being as second rate or deny him opportunities.

    "correct_answer": "Mrs Lena\u00a0Younger, otherwise known as Mama, is a lion hearted woman,\u00a0\u00a0a dutiful housewife and a loving all rolled into one. To that extent she is a remarkable character.\nMama is a strong willed widow who who proves herself to be effective matriarch of the younger family after the\u00a0death of her husband. In this regard she exercises a firm grip on her household. Like her late husband, she teaches her family to learn to love and never to be subservient. She cautions Bennie when she is becoming too atheistic in her views and prevails upon Walter to recognize the worth of Ruth, his wife. Significantly, she prevents the family from falling apart by buying a decent house for their comfort with a substantial portion of her husband's pension. She also prepares the family to brace itself for Ruth's second child rather than entertain such a morbid thought as abortion because of their economic difficulties.\nAs an understanding woman and dutiful housewife, Mama recalls with nostalgia, the wonderful time she spent with her late husband, its hardship notwithstanding. She downplays his waywardness, especially with women, but extols his virtue as a loving father, teaching his children to learn to live and be on their own. \"working and working and working like somebody's old horse\" and grieving himself almost to death when she lost Claude, her little baby.\nMama symbolizes the indomitable dream, the will and the consciousness of the average coloured person to work himself/herself into the middle class and get integrated into the larger American society by fighting racism in all its facets. This explains why she spends 35% of her late husband's pension to acquire a befitting house for her family in the so-called non-coloured area of Clybourne Park in spite of the risks.\nAs a caring, loving and listening mother, Mrs. Lena Younger epitomizes the universal image of motherhood. In this regard, she is very close to and profoundly shows affection to her children, her daughter-in-law and her grandson. She shares Bennie's aspirations to become a medical doctor.

    "explanation": "Mrs Lena\u00a0Younger, otherwise known as Mama, is a lion hearted woman,\u00a0\u00a0a dutiful housewife and a loving all rolled into one. To that extent she is a remarkable character.\nMama is a strong willed widow who who proves herself to be effective matriarch of the younger family after the\u00a0death of her husband. In this regard she exercises a firm grip on her household. Like her late husband, she teaches her family to learn to love and never to be subservient. She cautions Bennie when she is becoming too atheistic in her views and prevails upon Walter to recognize the worth of Ruth, his wife. Significantly, she prevents the family from falling apart by buying a decent house for their comfort with a substantial portion of her husband's pension. She also prepares the family to brace itself for Ruth's second child rather than entertain such a morbid thought as abortion because of their economic difficulties.\nAs an understanding woman and dutiful housewife, Mama recalls with nostalgia, the wonderful time she spent with her late husband, its hardship notwithstanding. She downplays his waywardness, especially with women, but extols his virtue as a loving father, teaching his children to learn to live and be on their own. \"working and working and working like somebody's old horse\" and grieving himself almost to death when she lost Claude, her little baby.\nMama symbolizes the indomitable dream, the will and the consciousness of the average coloured person to work himself/herself into the middle class and get integrated into the larger American society by fighting racism in all its facets. This explains why she spends 35% of her late husband's pension to acquire a befitting house for her family in the so-called non-coloured area of Clybourne Park in spite of the risks.\nAs a caring, loving and listening mother, Mrs. Lena Younger epitomizes the universal image of motherhood. In this regard, she is very close to and profoundly shows affection to her children, her daughter-in-law and her grandson. She shares Bennie's aspirations to become a medical doctor. She relates with Ruth caringly and offers to help her with her domestic chores.
