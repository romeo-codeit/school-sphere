Weed control improves penetration of sunlight for increased photosynthesis by phytoplanktons.\n(iv) Desilting: Removal of silts from the bottom of the pond will make the water clear so that adequate water is taken in.

If infection occurs it should be treated with appropriate drug such as copper sulphate, bromex, malachite green, potassium pamanganate.\n(x) Maintenance of water level: All sources of leakages should be block while the pond water should be brought to its required level.",
    "explanation": "(a) The following are factors to be considered when siting a fish pond: (i) quantity and quality of water supply (ii) \u00a0type of soil (iii) type and density of vegetation (iv) topography of the area (v) proximity to market (vi) climatic conditions\n(b) (i) Pond fertilization: Frequent application of fertilizers should be done to ensure efficient supply of aquatic plant food in the pond. It stimulates the growth \u00a0of phytoplanktons which are major suppliers of protein and carbohydrates needed for the rapid growth of the fish.\n(ii) Supplementary feeding: The natural food of planktons should be supplemented with artificial food e.g. groundnut cake, soyabean cake, maggot, etc.\n(iii) Weed control: Weeds should be removed from the pond in order other to ensure adequate supply of dissolved oxygen and ensure hygienic medium for the fish. Weed control improves penetration of sunlight for increased photosynthesis by phytoplanktons.\n(iv) Desilting: Removal of silts from the bottom of the pond will make the water clear so that adequate water is taken in. It also ensures adequate oxygen supply. It reduces turbidity of pond water and accumulation of ante feed. It is to maintain proper depth of fish pond\n(v) Eradication of predators: Carnivores such as snakes, frogs, crabs and wild fish should be removed from the pond. for maximum yield.\n(vi) Test cropping: This is don to check the growth rate of the fish to detect any outbreak of dose to know the food conversion ratio of fish stocked.\n(vii) Liming: Liming helps to correct pond activity and controls leaches. It enhances fertilizer effectiveness.\n(viii) Oxygen management /Aeration: This could be achieved through stirring water and allow the water splash into the pond. Weed control also improves aeration.\n(ix) Disease control: With good management, fish disease can be prevented.

Land is scarce .or limited in supply. It is immobile and heterogeneous and subject to the law of diminishing returns. The reward of land is rent. Land can appreciate or depreciate. Its suitability influences output and its location determines its value. Land can be used as collateral for bank loans.\n(ii) Labour refers to all human effort put into production. Sources of labour include personal labour, community labour, family labour, hired. labour etc. could be skilled or unskilled. Its reward is salary or wages. Labour is regarded as a variable factor of production. Its output can be improved by training. It is mobile.\n(iii) Capital refers to all man-made productive.assets which are used in production e.g. farm buildings, tools, money etc. It is mobile e.g. tractor. The amount determines volume or scope of operation. Its reward is interest.
