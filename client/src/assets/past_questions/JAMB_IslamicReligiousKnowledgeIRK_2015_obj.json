Among the purposes, two Qur'anic ayat reveals that we are created as the khalifa (vicegerent) [Surah al-Baqarah, 2:30] and for worshiping Allah alone. (Surah Hujurat, 49:13). Besides, our duties to our Lord, Allah, we are also responsible for others such as for our self, for other human and the creations including living and non-living creations. These are not merely our responsibility only but we are accountable for that. It means, we will be asked for each and every action we act in this worldly life",

If he intends to stay longer than that, it is not permissible for him to refrain from fasting except during transit. He may not refrain from fasting when he returns to his country because he is not considered a traveler but a resident.Imam Al-Shafi'i (may God be pleased with him) said in Asna Al-Mutalib: \"Whosoever approaches a country as a traveler who is not fasting, may break his fast there as long as he does not intend to stay there for more than four days.\"",

    "explanation": "In Islamic law, only relatives with a legitimate blood relationship to the deceased are entitled to inherit. Thus, illegitimate children and adopted children have no shares in inheritance. In general, a full brother will exclude a half-brother who shares a common father (\"consanguine brother), but not a half-brother who shares a common mother. In cases where a deceased man leaves a pregnant woman, the unborn child's share will be reserved. Also a woman during the time of waiting (\u02bfiddat) after divorce is considered a wife of the deceased for purposes of inheritance",

    "explanation": "But Arabia before Islam was a society where there were no rules, except that the strong dominated the weak. It seems reasonable to expect that a natural byproduct of such society would be the oppression of women. In fact, alongside the examples of strong and independent women, there are numerous reports of women having an inferior status. Female infanticide, for instance, was practiced by fathers who did not value their daughters as much as they valued their sons. In areas, such as marriage, divorce and inheritance, women were often deprived of their basic rights- to choose their husbands freely, to divorce if ill-treated or to inherit from their families",

    "explanation": "According to Ibn Sad, one of Muhammad's companions, the opposition in Mecca started when Muhammad delivered verses that condemned idol worship and polytheism. However, the Quran maintains that it began when Muhammad started public preaching.Among the first things Muhammad did to ease the longstanding grievances among the tribes of Medina was draft a document known as the Constitution of Medina, \"establishing a kind of alliance or federation\" among the eight Medinan tribes and Muslim emigrants from Mecca. The document specified rights and duties of all citizens and the relationship of the different communities in Medina (including between the Muslim community and other communities, specifically the Jews and other \"Peoples of the Book\"). The community defined in the Constitution of Medina, Ummah, had a religious outlook, also shaped by practical considerations, and substantially preserved the legal forms of the old Arab tribes.The first group of pagan converts to Islam in Medina were the clans who had not produced great leaders for themselves but had suffered from warlike leaders from other clans. This was followed by the general acceptance of Islam by the pagan population of Medina, with some exceptions.When Muhammad was in Mecca he faded opposition but was accepted when he got to Medina making the da'wah more far-reaching.",
