    "answer_url": "https://myschool.ng/classroom/economics/49306?exam_type=waec&type=obj&page=260",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Monopoly refers to a market situation where there is only single seller of a commodity and there are no close substitutes of that commodity. the following are features of a monopolist\n1.Single seller:\nThe producer or seller of the commodity is a single person, firm or an individual and that firm has complete control on the output of the commodity.\n2.No Close Substitutes:\nAll the units of a commodity are similar and there are no substitutes to that commodity.\n3.No Entry for New Firms:\nMonopoly situation in a market can continue only when other firms do not enter the industry. If new firms enter the industry, there will not be complete control of a firm on the supply. As such, whenever a firm enters the industry, monopoly situation comes to an end. There/art, monopoly industry is essentially one-firm industry. This signifies that under monopoly there is no differ\u00adence between a firm and an industry.\n4.Profit in the Long Run:\nA monopolist can earn abnormal profit even in the long run because he has no fear of a competitive seller. In other words, if a monopolist gets abnormal profits in the long run, he cannot be dislodged from this position. However, this is not possible under perfect competition. If abnormal profits are available to a competitive firm, other firms will enter the competition with the result abnormal profits will be eliminated.\n5.Losses in the Short Period:Generally, a common man thinks that a monopoly firm cannot incur loss because it can fix any price it wants. However, this understanding is not correct. A monopoly firm can sustain losses equal to fixed cost in the short period. A monopolist means that there is only a single person or a firm to sell the commodity.\n6.Nature of Demand Curve:\nUnder monopoly the demand for the commodity of the firm is less than being per\u00adfectly elastic and, therefore, it slopes downwards to the right. The main reason of the demand curve sloping downwards to the right is the complete control of the monopolist on the supply of the commodity. Due to control on the supply a monopolist makes changes in the supply which brings about changes in the price and because of this demand changes in the opposite direction.\n7.Price-discrimination:\nFrom the point of view of profit a monopolist can change different prices from different consumers of his commodity. This policy is known as price discrimination. He adopts the policy of price discrimination on various bases such as charging different prices from different consum\u00aders or fixing different prices at different places etc.\n8.Firm is a Price-Maker:\nA competitive firm is a price-taker whereas a monopoly firm is a price-maker. This is be\u00adcause a competitive firm is small compared to market and therefore, it does not have market power. This is not true in the case of a monopoly firm because it has market power. Hence, it is a price maker\n9.Average and Marginal Revenue Curves:\nUnder monopoly, average revenue is greater than marginal revenue. Under monopoly, if the firm wants to increase the sale it can do so only when it reduces its price. This means AR would decline when sale increases. In that case MR would be less than AR. (ii) AR slopes downwards to the right and is greater than MR.",
