    "explanation": "In the context of the passage, the sentence talks about medical experts emphasizing a particular approach within the last quarter of the twentieth century. The word that aligns well with this emphasis and fits the context is \"preventive.\" Preventive measures are actions taken to prevent or avoid something, and in the context of health, it refers to measures taken to prevent diseases or health issues.\nTherefore, the complete sentence would be: \"Within the last quarter of the twentieth century, medical experts have been laying emphasis on preventive rather than defensive measures.\" This means that the emphasis is on measures that prevent health issues rather than defensive measures taken after the issues have already occurred.",

The most appropriate word to fill the gap in this context is \"contracts.\" When an individual contracts a disease, it means that they have acquired or become infected with the disease. Option B, \"contracts,\" fits well with the meaning conveyed in the sentence.\nThe other options:\nA. acquires: While this is a possible synonym, \"contracts\" is more commonly used in the context of diseases.C. contacts: The correct verb in this context is \"contracts\" rather than \"contacts.\"D. develops: While individuals can develop diseases, the sentence is more focused on the acquisition or contraction of a disease.\nTherefore, option B, \"contracts,\" is the most suitable choice.",
