    "explanation": "The association between the root nodule of a leguminous plant and rhizobium sp is\u00a0a symbiotic relationship that benefits both the plant and the bacteria.\nRhizobium bacteria aresoil bacteria that infect the roots of leguminous plants and cause the formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules.\u00a0The bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which the plant can use for growth and development.Leguminous plantson the other hand with their\u00a0plant roots provide food to the rhizobia in the form of carbohydrates, such as malate and succinate.\nMycorrhiza\u00a0is\u00a0a symbiotic relationship between the roots of plants and fungi that benefits both organisms.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

Mixed-cropping\u00a0least affects food shortages because\u00a0Mixed cropping, or mixed crop-livestock farming, is a dominant agricultural model in sub-Saharan Africa. some of the reasons are due to:\nEnvironmental and social concerns:\u00a0Mixed farming is promoted to address environmental and social concerns.\nFood security:\u00a0Mixed crop-livestock systems are important for the food security of poor people in developing countries.\nRisk minimization:\u00a0Farmers use mixed cropping to minimize losses due to rainfall variability and pest.\nSub-Saharan Africa (SSA) experiences heavy flooding, and the frequency and intensity of these events is increasing.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
