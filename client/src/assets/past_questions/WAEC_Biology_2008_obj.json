    "explanation": "While resettling indigenous inhabitants might be a consequence of environmental degradation or development projects, it doesn't directly control or mitigate the effects of environmental degradation.\nReclaiming the land by restoring degraded lands can help revive ecosystems, Converting mining pits into fish ponds,\u00a0can be a form of rehabilitation, making use of existing excavations, and educating people can also help in\u00a0raising awareness and promoting sustainable practices which can significantly reduce environmental degradation.\nConsequently, option C is the correct answer.\nEducation, land reclamation, and innovative reuse of areas like mining pits can all contribute to controlling environmental damage.",
