    "explanation": "Given:- Original resistance \\( R_1 = 5 \\, \\Omega \\)- The new length \\( L_2 = 2L_1 \\) (where \\( L_1 \\) is the original length)- The new cross-sectional area \\( A_2 = \\frac{1}{2} A_1 \\) (where \\( A_1 \\) is the original area)\nStep 1: Recall the formula for resistance\nThe resistance \\( R \\) of a wire is given by:\n\\(R = \\rho \\frac{L}{A}\\)\nwhere:- \\( \\rho \\) is the resistivity,- \\( L \\) is the length,- \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area.\nStep 2: Calculate the new resistance\nThe new resistance \\( R_2 \\) can be calculated using the new length and new area:\n\\(R_2 = \\rho \\frac{L_2}{A_2}\\)\nSubstituting for \\( L_2 \\) and \\( A_2 \\):\n\\(R_2 = \\rho \\frac{2L_1}{\\frac{1}{2}A_1} = \\rho \\frac{2L_1 \\cdot 2}{A_1} = \\rho \\frac{4L_1}{A_1}\\)\nStep 3: Relate \\( R_1 \\) and \\( R_2 \\)\nFrom the original resistance \\( R_1 \\):\n\\(R_1 = \\rho \\frac{L_1}{A_1}\\)\nNow, we can express \\( R_2 \\) in terms of \\( R_1 \\):\n\\(R_2 = 4 \\left(\\rho \\frac{L_1}{A_1}\\right) = 4R_1\\)\nStep 4: Substitute the value of \\( R_1 \\)\nNow substitute \\( R_1 = 5 \\, \\Omega \\):\n\\(R_2 = 4 \\times 5 \\, \\Omega = 20 \\, \\Omega\\)\nTherefore, the\u00a0 new resistance is: \\(\\boxed{20 \\, \\Omega}\\)",
