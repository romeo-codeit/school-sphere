    "explanation": "Emphatic stress is the placement of greater stress on a particular word or syllable in an utterance. This is done for emphasis or clarification. In this case, emphatic stress is placed on \"staying\" in the utterance to clarify an error that was made in the question. This means that the question that should be selected should be one that contains a word or phrase that contrasts with \"staying\" while everything else remains the same. This is why \"Is Musa going through Enugu\" is the answer to this question.\nIs Musa going through Enugu?\nNo. Musa is STAYING in Enugu.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
