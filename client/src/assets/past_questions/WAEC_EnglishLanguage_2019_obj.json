    "explanation": "The first part of the sentence states: \"Many people find cod liver oil disgusting.\" To create an effective contrast, the second part of the sentence needs to convey a positive or at least neutral view of cod liver oil by soldiers.\nOption C, \"pleasant,\" is the best choice because it directly contrasts with \"disgusting.\" If soldiers find cod liver oil pleasant, it implies a positive or agreeable experience with it, which is the opposite of finding it disgusting. Therefore, \"pleasant\" serves to create the intended contrast in the sentence.\u00a0While \"refreshing\" generally implies something invigorating or revitalizing, it may not necessarily convey the sense of being pleasant or agreeable. On the other hand, \"pleasant\" directly conveys a positive and agreeable experience, making it a closer opposite to \"disgusting\" in this context.",
