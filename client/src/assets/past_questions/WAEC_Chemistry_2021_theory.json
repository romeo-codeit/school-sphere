The film of oxide formed is not porous and insoluble in water (in the air) and hence protects the metal underneath from further attack.ORThe film of oxide coats the metal and prevents it from further attack.\n(ii)\u00a0The composition of the ore:- Cryolite / Na\\(_{3}\\)AlF\\(_{6}\\) -Alumin\u00e0 / Al\\(_{2}\\)O\\(_{3}\\)\n(b) ZnO is an amphoteric oxide.
