The chain generally begins with an autotroph such as a green plant (e.g. stinging nettle ---> small tortoiseshell butterfly caterpillar --> house sparrow --> sparrowhawk), or with dead organic matter (detritus) (e.g. leaf litter --> earthworm --> young blackbird --> fox). The arrows indicate the passage of food, and therefore energy flow, from one organism to another.Pyramids of energy are the most accurate representation of feeding relationships in a community, providing information about the amount of energy flowing through each trophic level over a set period of time.Food web involve many complex feeding relationship and most most ecosystems are more complex than food chain\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Adaptation is process by which an animal or plant species becomes fitted to its environment; it is the result of natural selection\u2019s acting upon heritable variation. Even the simpler organisms must be adapted in a great variety of ways: in their structure, physiology, and genetics, in their locomotion or dispersal, in their means of defense and attack, in their reproduction and development, and in other respects.Evolution explains how living things change over a long time, and how they have come to be the way they areVariation is any difference between cells, individual organisms, or groups of organisms of any species caused either by genetic differences (genotypic variation) or by the effect of environmental factors on the expression of the genetic potentials (phenotypic variation). Variation may be shown in physical appearance, metabolism, fertility, mode of reproduction, behaviour, learning and mental ability.Succession is the process by which the structure of a biological community evolves over time. Two different types of succession\u2014primary and secondary\u2014have been distinguished. Primary succession occurs in essentially lifeless areas\u2014regions in which the soil is incapable of sustaining life as a result of such factors as lava flows, newly formed sand dunes, or rocks left from a retreating glacier.Secondary succession occurs in areas where a community that previously existed has been removed; it is typified by smaller-scale disturbances that do not eliminate all life and nutrients from the environment.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
