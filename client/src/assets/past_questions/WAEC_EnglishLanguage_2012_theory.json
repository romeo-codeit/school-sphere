    "correct_answer": "Keke Senior High School,\nLow Cost Housing Estate,\nIfako ljaiye\nLagos State.\n20th July, 2012.\nDear Father,\nYour letter dated 22nd of May, 2012 came to my school at the appropriate time. My inability to reply to the letter on time is due to the fact that the time of its arrival coincided with the commencement of my West African Examinations Council Schools Certificate Examination (WASSCE) for May/June 2012 Nevertheless, I decided to reply to the letter at the end of the exams.\nDaddy, having spent about six weeks in this school and having followed closely the trend of events and academic records of the school, I feel the solemn urge to let you know my experiences so far in the school.\nFirst, the administrative set up of the school is no doubt second to none This has brought about a conducive academic atmosphere between the teaching staff and the students. The introduction of the Students Representative Council in my first week in the school has contributed in no small measure to the unparalleled cooperation between the various organs of the school. This has brought about a peaceful environment, devoid of the usual wrangling and needless agitations that characterized the administrative set up of my former school.\nFurthermore, the school's tone and standard of discipline is very high. The teachers are epitome of discipline and hard work. Hence. lazy students are compelled to ship in or ship out. They come to school very early. do all that was expected of them with minimal supervision and during school's hour. Apart from the break time. the silence enveloping the school can be compared to that of the grave yard. This disciplinary tone of the school coupled with the students academic performance make her the cynosure of all eyes.\nIn addition to this, the co-curricular activities of the school are beautifully planned and implemented. Every student is compelled to be a member of at least one society or club. Each society or club is coordinated by a teacher and officers elected among the students. This has created a sense of duty and belonging among the students and between the officers and the coordinating teacher. Hence. each society or club is given specific date to present its social and academic activities to the students at a general assembly specially called for that purpose. This has brought about a spirit of cooperation and togetherness in the students.\nDaddy, I am very happy to inform you that my coming to this school is a blessing in disguise. The reasons are too many to be written in this letter but it is very important to tell you that my academic attitude has changed. Here, in the area of academics. it is the survival of the fittest, hence all hands must be on deck all the time. In my school one has little or no time for unproductive activities.\nLastly. daddy. I want to thank you for granting me the permission to change to this school. It is not a fruitless effort. Extend my warmest regards to the rest of the family Till we meet at the end of the third term.\nYours sincerely.\nAdejoke.",

He decided that this time, he would give them the rough edge of his tongue. \u00a0They had come because earlier callers had not reported what he had stressed: \u00a0that he was not in Kapitatown for anyone's sake.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He took his time to put his office and workshop in order. determined not to leave in a hurry just because of some stubborn fortune-seekers. He made sure that all his seventy-two workers had signed out before he signaled to his driver. There, in the huge limousine, he thought of the new multi-million dollar contract for his construction company and how he would get a helicopter from the profit. That would be the ultimate \u00a0solution to the persistent problem of the traffic congestion which he faced in Kapitatown.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The five-kilometre distance to his mansion was covered in about two hours. On arrival, his youngest wife informed i him that his visitors were chiefs from Ireti. He felt a revulsion as he imagined that they must have come with a king-size request. As he entered the house. he steeled his mind. However. the three chiefs disarmed him with their cheerful smiles. Each met him in the doorway with a bear hug. As soon as the chit-chat ended, \u00a0they announced that the Ireti ruling council had decided to confer on him the highest traditional title of the land and that a date had been set for the great event. He was flabbergasted; so they had come with an offer. He immediately accepted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thereafter, things moved very fast. He contacted all the great names in the country, among them his state governor, the top politicians in the land and his business associates from far and near. However, he did not even pay a preparatory visit to Ireti. He took everything for granted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The great day came. Hundreds of limousines from far and near streamed into Ireti.

The house had been turned into a museum by one of the several organizations \u00a0that fought the scourge Among the most outstanding features of the museum were the several statues of slaves in different postures black slaves being captured in their native homes, being chained together, being led to the port for sale, on the slave ship and being forced to work on plantations The sculptures were particularly remarkable \u00a0in that they illustrated very movingly the bane which Wilberforce threw himself against.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a black man I could not help shedding tears when going from room to room on the two floors. Then, there was a period of pandemonium which I. unwittingly, caused. I was on the first floor, about to cross the lobby, when I came face to face with another visitor. a white man. When he saw me, a wave of fright swept through him. \u00a0His eyes were immediately bloodshot. He shouted out of fright and ran back. Quickly, he made for the staircase, sped down to the ground floor, and took to his heels.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All this while. I remained still, at a loss as to the cause of his action. He stopped shouting only when he got into the bus that brought his group. \u00a0Meanwhile. others around him. realizing the cause of his fright, came to tell me that I was\nthe cause. They laughed it off when they told me that he had thought I was one of the statues and. had left suddenly\u00a0turned into a human being. I discovered the reason for his fright when I entered the room which he had just left\u00a0and found that It one of the statues looked exactly like me. Whoever did the wax model perhaps had my picture. was my height, my shape, my complexion, indeed the exact replica\u00a0of me.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I realized what had happened. I was the only black present in the building. The man had not expected a live black person to be in the museum. Thus, the sudden sight of a black person moving around, with the stature and face of one of the statues, should certainly frighten him. I wondered what could have happened if I had pursued \u00a0him down the staircase.\n(a) In what capacity did the writer visit the museum?\n(b) For what was William Wilberforce famous?\n(c) Why did the writer stand out among the visitors in the museum at that hour?\n(d) Why was the other man frightened?\n(e) by had the man assumed that the writer was a statue that had come alive?\n(f) \"a wave of fright swept through him...\" (i) What figure of speech is contained in the expression above? (ii) What does it mean?\n(g) \"...that brought his group...\"\n(i) What grammatical name is given to this expression as it is used in the passage?\n(ii) What is its function?\n(h) For each of the following words, find another word or phrase which means the same and which can replace it as it is used in the passage: (i) organizations; (ii) remarkable; (iii) pandemonium; (iv) replica; (v) pursued.",

Experts in urbanization fear that the ever-growing slums in the world will soon become more populous than the cities. Findings like these, however. do not show clearly the devastating effect which substandard living conditions have on the poor. The situation is more serious in developing countries, where many people lack basic amenities, adequate housing and modem health care services.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is an irony that while some of the richest nations want to build colonies on the moon and explore Mars, growing numbers of their poorest citizens cannot afford a decent place to live here on earth. It might be easy to conclude that the poor could remedy their situation if they showed more initiative. but factors involved in the housing crisis are beyond their control. The world's population is increasing at an alarming rate. such that millions of houses are needed to keep pace with this development.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is a fact that cities provide more facilities than the rural areas. It is easier to get electricity and good water supply, pursue one's education and secure well-paid jobs in cities than villages. Very often those in the villages hanker for such opportunities. One cannot therefore blame them when they seize the first opportunity to reside n the cities. They do not mind going away from the villages to reside in congested cities. thereby contributing to over-population in the cities. In troubled areas of the world. political disasters. civil wars and suicide bombing are common Poor people, women and children run away from such troubled areas to preserve their lives They seek refuge in whatever shelter they can find when existing buildings are completely destroyed The relationship between housing and poverty cannot be ignored. People who cannot afford basic necessities as food and clothing. may not be able to rent or build decent houses. These and other factors have forced millions of people to settle for substandard housing They live in abandoned buses, shipping containers, cardboard boxes and other unthinkable places.\nThe housing problems. just like many other problems facing the world should be tackled with urgency. However, the cost of land for the erection of houses is high Even when land is secured. the high cost of building materials is another problem to contend with. One must not therefore blame building agencies which employ methods that enable them to build inexpensive houses\n(a) In five sentences, one for each state the causes of the worldwide housing problems.\n(b) In one sentence. summarize the measures that poor people have adopted to solve their housing problem.",
