It\u00a0is considered the major building block of organismsbecause of\u00a0its unique ability to form stable bonds with many different elements, including itself, allowing it to create complex, diverse, and large molecules necessary for life, like proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids, which are the foundation of all living things.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "explanation": "The process by which plants lose water to the atmosphere is called\u00a0transpiration.\nTranspiration is the process by which plants release water into the atmosphere as water vapour.\u00a0It occurs through stomata, which are tiny pores on the surface of leaves that allow plants to exchange gases with the atmosphere.\u00a0Transpiration also occurs through evaporation from the surfaces of leaves, stems, and flowers. Guttation also involves water loss but there is difference between the two.\nTranspiration is the process where plants lose water vapour through tiny pores called stomata on their leaves,whileguttation is the release of liquid water droplets from specialized structures called hydathodes, usually located on the edges of leaves, occurring when the plant absorbs water faster than it can transpire,creating a pressure that forces the water out;\u00a0essentially,transpiration is water loss as vapour, andguttation is water loss as liquid droplets.\nTranslocation is\u00a0the process by which plants move dissolved materials, like sugars and nutrients, throughout the plant.\nEvaporation\" in plants refers to\u00a0the process called transpiration, where water absorbed by the plant roots travels through the plant's vascular system and exits as water vapour through tiny pores on the leaves called stomata.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

Protozoans are single-celled organisms that lack a true mouth and anus, instead they have a single opening that serves both the entrance and exit point for nutrients, wastes and other materials. E.g Amoeba, paramecium etc. Protists also have a single\u00a0opening, though certain types of algae or protozoans with\u00a0complex cell structures might have multiple openings for feeding, reproduction etc(dinoflagellates, ciliates like paramecium), but generally, protists don't have double openings in the classical sense.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

In other words, Anatomy is the study of the body's physical structure, while physiology is the study of how the body functions.\nWhile both comparative anatomy and physiological evidence can support the concept of the pentadactyl forelimb in vertebrates, the key difference lies in the focus of study:comparative anatomyexamines thestructural similarities in bone arrangement across different species, whereasphysiological evidenceinvestigates howthe limb functionsandadapts to different behaviours in each species;\u00a0essentially, comparative anatomy looks at the \"blueprint\" of the limb, while physiology examines how that structure is used in different contexts.\nEmbryological evidence of the pentadactyl forelimb of vertebrates includes the\u00a0regulation of gene expression during limb development.\nThe fossil record of pentadactyl forelimbs shows that many vertebrates have a similar bone structure, even though their limbs look different on the outside.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "explanation": "Counter-shading is a form of camouflage that helps organisms blend into their surroundings.\u00a0Counter-shading is\u00a0a coloration pattern where the parts of an animal that are usually in shadow are lighter in colour, and the parts that are usually in light are darker.\u00a0This makes the animal more difficult to detect by reducing the contrast between the animal and its background.\nChameleons do not exhibit counter-shading, but they do have active camouflage that allows them to change their colour to match their environment.\u00a0This pattern is used by many animals, including fish, birds, reptiles, mammals, etc.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "explanation": "Hibernation is\u00a0a natural behavior that allows animals to survive the winter by slowing down their metabolism and body temperature.\u00a0Hibernating animals use stored fat for energy while they are inactive.\nAestivation is\u00a0a state of dormancy that animals enter during hot and dry periods to conserve energy and avoid dehydration.\u00a0It's similar to hibernation, but occurs in the summer instead of winter.\nCounter-shading is a camouflage technique where an animal's upper body is darker and its lower body is lighter. It is an adaptive feature that enables animals to remain undetected or unnoticed.\nAnimal migration is\u00a0when animals move from one place to another in a regular pattern.\u00a0Migrations can be seasonal, but other factors like rainfall can also influence them.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
