    "correct_answer": "Life for black people in South Africa is cheerless. The people are oppressed and they lack prospects for a good ife. As far as work goes, they can have only the menial jobs. By law, black people must carry passbooks without which they cannot get work, or move about without getting into trouble with the authorities.\nThis is the society in which Sizwe finds himself when he arrives in Port Elizabeth without valid papers. Therefore, his stay there is considered illegal, even though he is a native of the land. His discovery in Zola's place leads to his finding refuge in Buntu's place.\nWhile returning with Buntu from an evening out, he encountered a dead man on a rubbish dump. This leads to his so-called \"death\". Buntu comes up with the idea that Sizwe swap identities with the dead man. He even explains that the dead man would have approved Sizwe's adoption of his identity. With the replacing of the dead man's picture in his passbook with Sizwe's, Sizwe Bansi becomes Robert Zwelinzima. The best thing that happens in the life of Sizwe is this \"death\".\nThe immediate significance of this \"death\" is that it enables Sizwe, alias Robert, to avoid imminent repatriation to King Williams's town. Thus he can now live in Port Elizabeth by right and by preference. His \"death\" also entitles him to work and to have some marginal dignity in the society. It is ironical that it requires Sizwe's \"death\" in the manner it occurs for him to survive in his own country.",

    "correct_answer": "The preparation for the visit of Henry Ford to the Assembly Plant exposes the evils of racial discrimination and particularly the oppressive nature of the apartheid system of government in South Africa. Mr. Henry Ford is to visit the plant in order to commission the expansion of the car plant. Baas Bradley is the foreman. He does all within his power to see to it that the preparations for the visit of the plant proprietor does not fail.\nFirst, there is a notice for all the workers informing them of Fords's visit and the preparations to be made. The next thing is Baas Bradley's instruction that there be a general cleaning. Styles recalls that during the general cleaning, -iot water with brushes and electric mops are used to wash the floors first, then the thick oil and dirt under the machines are washed. In no time the place is spotless \"like you would have thought it had just been built\".\nThe second stage of the preparation involves the painting and marking of safety precautions. This Styles says has not been done for the past five years. These safety precautions are marked in different colours of paint and translated into the native language of the black workers.\nAt the end of all the washing and painting, the workers are directed to have a hot shower so that they can look Jean and fresh. To do this, they are given soap and a towel each. The workers are clean to the point that they feel very embarrassed for being fresh because they are not used to it.\nThe next step in the preparation is the supply of new working tools to the workers. Styles observes that his tools needed replacement a year earlier but have not been replaced until now. New overalls are equally given to the workers to make them look as if they are always using new tools and overalls. Brand new fire proof aprons are also given :a them.\nArmed with all these necessary tools, the workers are to get back to work, sing and pretend that they are sappy to be part of Mr. Ford's plant.\nStyles is asked by Mr. Baas Bradley to translate these instructions to his fellow black workers. He mimicks\u00a0Baas Bradley in a satirical manner and this adds to the humour of the play. Again, this further exposes the hypocrisy of the whites in South Africa. Through the translation too, the workers are told that the light will be slowed so that they can ,work and sing when Mr. Ford arrives. However, when the august visitor arrives, he does not even look at the plant nor the workers.",

Mr. Ofosu discusses the situation with his friend Lawyer Bonu who, for his own selfish reason, encourages Mr, Ofosu to insist on Maanan becoming a lawyer. Mr. Ofosu has great faith and trust in his friend, and accordingly forces Maanan to work in Bonu's office as preparatory towards becoming a lawyer. Lawyer Bonu takes advantage of his friend's trust in him to make advances to Maanan, knowing that Mr. Ofosu will not believe whatever Maanan says. The sexual harassment continues. When Mr. Ofosu hears of it, he refuses to believe it and accuses his family of plotting against his friend. Finally, Lawyer Bonu is caught in the act while on a visit to the Ofosu home. This is betrayal of friendship at its worst. Naturally, Ofosu feels terribly let down by his friend.",

By this deception, humour and suspense are sustained. Bobchinsky and Dobchinsky are informed by Vlass that a certain guest, a young man whom the two have noticed, is from Petersburg. He has been lodging at the inn for two weeks and appears to be in no hurry to leave while eating on credit. Having had wind of a letter warning the Mayor of the imminent arrival of an official who is coming from Petersburg incognito to inspect the whole province', they wrongly conclude that he is the expected official.\nConvinced of their discovery, Bob and Dob hurry to the Mayor, disrupt the meeting at which the very matter of the visit is being discussed, and deliver the deceptive news that the personage is already in town. There is humorous panic among the deceived Mayor and the local authority officials. The Mayor, taken in by the news, decides to meet the supposed visiting official, tacitly acknowledging his own corrupt dealings. The deception is reinforced as the Mayor strives to bribe Hlestakov. The other local officials follow suit. The merchants take their place in the queue to offer inducements to Hlestakov to take up their grievances against the Mayor. Hlestakov himself is full of deception. Seeing that he has been mistaken for a more important personage than he is, he reinforces the deception by extorting bribes as loans that he obviously does not intend to repay.\nHlestakov worms his way into the affection of Anna, who, being deceived, persuades her husband to give his blessing to a union between their daughter and Hlestakov. The deception is humorous and keeps the plot moving through its suspense.\nThe announcement of the engagement of Marya to the imposter causes great excitement.

In fact, the power of the poem rests on the effective use of figures of speech and almost every line owes its meaning to one figure of speech or the other. It is these that the poet uses to express his deep love for his mistress, Naett, symbolizing the black woman and by extension the African continent. The opening lines contain similes and metaphors powerfully expressed. Naett's name is \"mild like cinnamon\".\nThis simile creates the central image of Naett's sensuousness which runs through the poem. The metaphor which follows moves from the image of taste to that of smell: \"the fragrance in which the lemon grove sleeps\". The overall impression here is one of beauty and sensuousness. Other figures of speech enhance this impression of beauty and sensuousness. There is the metaphor of the\u00a0\"booming coffee trees\", for example. However, one senses that Senghor is not only concerned with creating an image of beauty and sensuousness alone. Naett's resilience is also in focus.\nIn an effective simile, he compares her to \"the Savannah that blossoms forth under the masculine ardour of the midday sun\". This not only demonstrates Naett's beauty and sensuousness but also her ability to thrive under the most adverse conditions.\nFrom this point on, Naett becomes a symbol of both beauty and strength. She is compared to the violent tornado in the metaphor, \"Naett, that is the dry tornado\" and to lightning in the metaphor which follows: the hard clap of lightning. She emerges here as both an object of terrifying beauty and also a symbol of great strength.\nThe metaphor in \"Naett coin of gold\" and the oxymoron in \"shining coal\" express the fact that her beauty is hard to define. In these two figures of speech are encapsulated the thoughts which Senghor has been expressing all along. that is, Naett is black, sensuous and radiant.",

    "correct_answer": "The dance symbolizes the poet's yearning to be identified with his roots. He regrets his inability to take part in this particular cultural dance as he has been, in his own words \"early sequestered from my tribe\".\nThe poet is fascinated with this aspect of his culture which engages the dancer in an act \"intervolving earth, sky and flesh\". This is expressed in his powerful description of the dancer as she wriggles her body in complete abandon. He describes the dance as a \"magic maze\" of music with its \"intricate pattern rippling crest after crest\".\nThe dancer contrasts sharply with the poet as the dance signifies her deep knowledge of, and involvement in, her culture. The poet's cultural alienation manifests itself in his inability to participate in such an infectious dance. His level of involvement is restricted only to admiration. He could feel the \"communal call\" but is unable to respond to it. Thus we see his frustration conveyed at the end of the poem, when he could only wish to be part of the dance.",

Indeed, the song and the valley are fused together and both exercise a profound influence on the speaker. The influence is such that long after he leaves the scene he still carries the song in his heart.\nThe idea of the nightingale being able to sing \"welcome notes\" to \"weary bands of travelers\" or the 'cuckoo bird' singing \"to break the silence of the seas\" also shows the power of nature on man.\nIt needs to be noticed that the song's influence on the man is everlasting.

    "correct_answer": "Marvell employs several images to express his love to his mistress and his overwhelming desire to consummate their love. His use of the pair of allusions - the \"Indian Ganges\", and the \"Tide of Humber\" - sets the tone. In reference to these images, Marvell asserts that not even the geographical distance that may come between them can dampen his love for his mistress. These images are appropriately followed by the metaphor of \"my vegetable love\" which \"will grow vaster than empires\". What Marvell suggests here is that his love, like a plant, has the faculty of growth that does not diminish.\nOther images then follow involving hyperbolical references to the number of years it will take him to adore the various parts of his mistress's body.\nBut as the poem continues, Marvell abandons the earlier images and brings in the notion that his love for his mistress is bound by time. Thus we have images of the \"winged chariots\", \"deserts of vast eternity\" which suggest the ravages of time which both lovers cannot escape. Indeed, the image of \"the grave's a fine and private place / But none I think do there embrace\" heightens the catastrophe which awaits the lovers if they do not embrace.\nAs the poem ends, fresh images are introduced.

Again, Elia serves as a role model to women who, in spite of the fact that they are saddled with the responsibility of carrying out these enormous tasks, refuse to trade away their dignity and flirt around with the menfolk.\nThrough her, a profound statement is made on the injustice in a society that treats womanhood with contempt and subjects them to constant harassment, intimidation and oppression. All in all, Ella Wright is a very caring and loving mother who plays a prominent role in the novel.",

    "correct_answer": "Gold plays a very important role in the development of Silas Marner's personality. Gold, in the novel, may be understood as a general term for money, The terms may therefore be used interchangeably. The theft of the bag of money by William Dane at the death of the deacon provides Dane the opportunity to break up t'e engagement between Silas and Sarah.\nThe theft also leads to the casting of lots. The lots declare Silas as the culprit. This leads Marner to leave Lantern Yard and settle at Raveloe. His heart is full of bitterness and his faith in man and God shattered.\nAt Raveloe, he puts all his strength and mind into his weaving, and gold (money) starts trickling in. The gold accumulates and becomes his passion. He now finds a new companion in his gold. This contributes to his further alienation from the society. Henceforth, his only contact with the society is reduced to buying the few necessities he needs for his weaving and food. He thus becomes a complete hermit with his gold providing the only companionship he needs. He then becomes more mechanical and less human. This continues until he loses his gold.\nThe loss of his gold now provides the first occasion for him to really interact with people. Many of the superstitions people attach to him disappear. He begins to attract the sympathy of others. -The process of his re-integration into the society comes with the coming of Eppie who, in the mind of Silas Marner, has mme to replace his gold. In fact the lost gold provides the strongest motive for keeping Eppie.\nIt is significant to note that Eppie has yellow or golden hair and Marner takes her to be his gold that has returned. In Eppie, Marner now has a companion.\nWhen eighteen years later the gold is rediscovered, it now has a better use. It seems as if the gold goes away and comes back when Marner has better use for it. The gold, from this perspective, takes on a mysterious outlook in conformity with Marner's own mysterious life as it often does in fairy tales.\nIt can therefore be said that gold has multiple roles in the novel. It serves as an instrument of Marner's separation tom the society and of his re-integration into the society. It also provides an atmosphere of mystery.",

Silas is highly regarded in the church assembly in Lantern Yard where he worships with his best friend, William Dane.\nSilas is known to be a young man of exemplary life and ardent faith. Silas loves William Dane but it soon becomes apparent that he does not love him return. When Silas has a 'cataleptic lit' and everybody sees it as a 'divine visitation' it is William alone who sees it as a visitation from the devil. Silas is hurt by his friend's uncomplimentary interpretation and derogatory remarks. He is discouraged by his friend's doubts as he believes that William is the one person who should know him better than everyone else. Silas' trust in William manifests itself in his invitation to join him and Sarah on their Sunday afternoon outings.\nDuring this period, Silas notices a certain coldness in Sarah's behaviour to him. Silas' trusting nature is soon to suffer a sudden jolt when he and William Dane take turns in watching over the sick Deacon. William fails to turn up on a night he is to relieve Silas and in the morning, the Deacon is found dead and the church money missing. Responsibility for the theft is attributed to Silas but it soon becomes clear that William is responsible. He has deliberately framed Silas to get rid of him. Silas' realization of William's evil has a devastating effect on him. When he realizes that William has taken over his betrothed, Sarah, he loses complete faith in the goodness of human beings.\nThis betrayal affects him for the rest of his life. William's treachery also contributes to Silas' loss of faith in God. The lots which Silas hopes will clear him of the charges levied against him declare him guilty.",
