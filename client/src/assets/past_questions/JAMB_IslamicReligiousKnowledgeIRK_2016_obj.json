    "explanation": "it is writing that \"Verily the spendthrifts are brothers of the shaytan (Devil) ...\" Those who spend lavishly are the associate of Satan. A man should not reserve his earnings and his wealth exclusively for his own person. He should do his utmost to fulfill his own necessities of life in a moderate way and render the rights of his relatives, neighbors and other needy persons as well. This attitude will help create the spirit of cooperation, sympathy and justice in the collective Islamic life. Thus every relative will cooperate with the other and every rich person will help the needy in his neighborhood and a wayfarer would find himself an honorable guest among generous hosts.",

    "explanation": ": in Suratul_Ikhlas Q.112:3 \"He neither begot any nor was He begotten\".The polytheists in every age have adopted the concept that like men, gods also belong to a species, which has many members and they also get married, beget and are begotten. They did not even regard Allah, Lord of the universe, as supreme and above this concept of ignorance, and even proposed children for Him. There are lots of Verses that dispute that like; \" Allah is only One Deity: He is far too exalted that He should have a son: whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth belongs to Him. ( Surah An-Nisa, Ayat 171 ).\"\"They, in fact, invent a falsehood when they say, Allah has children. They are utter liars. ( Surah As-Saaffat, Ayats 151-152 ).\"",

Each of the three times must be complete - for example, one cannot wash different parts of his face each of the three times such that ultimately his entire face is washed. On the contrary, one should wash his face completely thrice.- Each step should be done immediately after the previous one, such that the washed parts of the body do not dry up. This is waivered if one is forced to go get more water.- Washing the two hands before inserting them into the container [of water], [especially] after the person performing Wudhu has awaken from his sleep.- Rinsing the mouth three times; taking water to the back of the mouth unless one is fasting.- Inhaling water to the soft upper part of the nose and exhaling it three times. The right hand should be used to inhale water and the left hand should be used while exhaling it.- Washing the face thoroughly three times. All parts [of the face] must be washed, including the corners of the eyes and the various grooves on the face.- [For men,] combing the beard thoroughly with wet hands such that water reaches the skin beneath.- Wash arms up to just above the elbows, using the other hand, to rub the running water thoroughly over the arm.- Wiping the ears - the index fingers washing inside every fold of the front of the ear and the thumb wiping behind the ear.- Wiping from forelock to back of the head. Use all fingers other than index finger and thumb, as index finger and thumb are reserved for the ears.- Combing the fingers and washing in between toes with the little finger.",
