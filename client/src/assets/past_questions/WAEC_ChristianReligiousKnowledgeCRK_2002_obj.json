    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Amos, the herdsman of Tekoa, was sent from God with a powerfulmessageof correction for the ancient House of Israel. In spite of withering opposition, he fearlessly indicted the nation for its hollow, meaningless piety, social injustice and general immorality.\u00a0His message was to warn the nation of Israel, who had gotten arrogant and hardened toward the poor and oppressed that He was going to judge them by having their enemies conquer them. Israel's relationship with God was unique but not exclusive.\u00a0 In commencement, doom is defined as judgment. Given this definition and in line with the topic under discussion it cannot be dismissed as far-fetched to suppose that Amos was a prophet of doom. It can be argued that doom is at the core of Amos' message and this doom came as a result of various sins which were committed by the Israelite nation. These sins include rampant corruption in the courts, social injustice as well as idolatry. It must be pointed out that these sins breached the covenant between Yahweh and the Israelites. As a result, this has led many scholars to argue that Amos indeed was a prophet of doom. While acknowledging that Amos was a prophet of doom it will be a misnomer of judgement to conclude along those lines. A closer glance at Amos' book can lead one to point out that Amos was a prophet of hope.",
