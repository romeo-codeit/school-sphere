Similarly, temperate latitude are warmer than polar latitudes.\n(ii) ALTITUDE:-Places nearer the earth's surface are warmer than those at higher altitude. Temperature decreases with increasing height above sea-level. The late of decrease in temperature is 0.6\u00b0C with an ascent of 100m above sea-level. Example: Mount Kilimanjaro (about 6000m) although close to the Equator is always snow capped, Jos Plateau and the Guinea Highland in West Africa are good examples.\n(iii) DISTANCE FROM THE SEA:-Land surfaces heat and cool faster than sea surfaces. The sea warms coastal regions in winter but cools them in summer. In summer, land surfaces are warmer than sea surfaces and the air over the land, therefore, is warmer than the one over the sea which make coastal regions to be cooler than inland.\n(iv) PREVAILING WINDS:-Winds affect temperature by transporting their heat or coldness into adjacent regions. On-shore Westerlies convey much tropical warm air to temperate coasts especially in winter. In Britain and Norway Westerlies tend to be cool winds in summer and warm variable in moderating the climate. Local winds such as Fohn, Chinook, Sirocco, Mistral also produce marked changes in temperature. The North-East trade wind from the Sahara lowers the night and morning temperatures of the Sahel region.\n(v) OCEAN CURRENTS:-Warm ocean currents tend to have increased temperature.
