    "correct_answer": "Fofo and Odarley are street children scrounging for a living around the Agbogboloshie market area. Fofo flees one early morning to Odarley's shack after her es-cape from the hands of the rapist, Poison. The plight of street children is highlighted during this visit. An attempt has just been made by a 'street lord' to rape Fofo, a fourteen-year-old homeless girl, as she sleeps in front of a provision shop in Agbogbloshie market. In her unprotected condition, she is exposed to the va-garies of the weather and the ravages of lawless men. Odarley's shack offers only a slightly better protec-tion. The description of the shack is striking. The lack of adequate ventilation and children strewn about the single room in various states of undress, underscore the poverty, destitution and degradation which chil-dren who are forced to fend for themselves have to face. Social immorality has now become a part of the children's lives.\nThe shoeshine boy and the iced wa-ter seller are fast asleep, naked. Odarley surmises that the couple had sex the night before. Indiscrimi-nate sex no longer shocks the children. Odarley is, herself, a part of the group. Thus, she conjectures that because she still has her underpants on, the shoe-shine boy had probably mistaken the iced water seller for her. The import here is that she and the shoeshine boy have had sexual encounters in the past. It is in these circumstances that Fofo comes to visit Odarley. In addition to the lack of morals already mentioned, the scene paints a vivid picture of the squalor and filth in which the children wallow during the course of thier daily lives. Odarley and Fofo ease themselves at a rubbish dump in the vicinity. They are not the only ones there. This is a popular place of convenience. Though there is mention of a public toilet, the motiva-tion to go there appears to be very low. While the \"busi-ness\" of easing themselves is in progress, it is learnt that Fofo is suffering from constipation, probably as a result of her having had to live only on bread and water the previous day: \"Yesterday was a bad day\". This information is introduced so casually that the impres-sion is given that it is a normal occurrence. The focus here is on the deprivation of the children.\nThe atmosphere of insecurity in the location is also quite adequately conveyed. Macho, a street bully and petty criminal, pounces on the children as they are easing themselves, frightens them away and grabs\u00a0Fofo's plastic bag which contained all the money she made the prevoius week. In this vicinity might is right and only the strong survive. The victims cannot seek redress from the law. Strength and power reign supreme.\nPoints to Note:\n(i) Lack of security/protection\n(ii) Lack of decent accomodation\n(iii) Prevalence of social immorality\n(iv) Lack of convenience\n(v) Prevalent lawlessness\n(vi) Prevalent squalor",

Baby T's predicament brings to the fore the responsibility of society for the terrible condition in which neglected children, more especially the female, find themselves in present day society. The title of the novel \"faceless\", is an adequate description of Baby T. Like her younger sister Fofo, Baby T represents the count-less \"faceless\" girls who roam the streets. Baby T is faceless, nondescript, without identity and without recognition by society. Significantly, she does not even have a name of her own.

At first she is called \"Tsuru's baby', then \"Baby Tsuru', and later the name evolves to just `Baby T'.\nThis lack of recognition is accentuated by the attitudes of the police after her body is found badly mutilated behind the kiosk in Agbogboloshie market. Her case is merely filed. No one makes any effort, not even a pretense, at carrying out an investigation into the circumstances leading to her murder. Baby T is a victim of social injustice both in life and in death. Her travails start right in her own home. She is born into a family struggling to survive.

He does not stop for one moment to thick that his action will drive his children into the sanctions imposed by society for this behavior. In fact, he appears to receive tacit support from his relatives.

It is held that every pregnancy of a hunter's wife results in the birth of a child that looks like an animal: long-necked like the giraffe, large-eyed like the buffalo, or scaly-skinned like the crocodile. Consequently, Yaremi is warned of the inherent dan-ger in contemplating marriage with Ajumobi. So, during their courtship, the people of Kufi and Adeyipo keep close watch over Yaremi and Ajumobi, and conclude that their marriage will never stand the test of time. However, the people of Kufi are proved wrong. Their (Yaremi and Ajumobi's) marriage works out pretty well. Yaremi gives birth to beautiful children, male and female, who have no blemish whatsoever.

Manfred is aware of the ancient prophecy and is afraid it might be fulfilled because he is not the legitimate owner. This fear prompts him to arrange between his ailing son, Conrad and Isabella who belongs to the line of the true heirs. Since Frederic is presumed dead, it is easy for Manfred to gain approval for the insipid union. But this is not to be.

It is seen in the play that the people of Mando land respect their ancestral beliefs. They are very much alive to the threat posed by the coming into their midst of a stranger.

It is greatly ironical that Whitehead should suggest the killing of a goat, for the killing of a virgin is not within the experience of Soko, the Chief Priest, as Soko confesses to Wara.\nTagged on to the regard for human life is the culture of severe punishment for a serious crime.

    "explanation": "The home setting of the Youngers throws light upon them as a close-knit family.

    "answer_url": "https://myschool.ng/classroom/literature-in-english/50568?exam_type=waec&type=theory&page=7",
    "correct_answer": "Mrs. Younger, Mama, is portrayed as a traditional woman. Mama belongs to the class of women that believe that men should always be in charge. Thus, she never fails to tell who her husband was and how she submitted to him. After her husband's death, she is the matriarch of the family, the one that the rest of the family looks up to. She is initially disappointed that Walter Jr. is unable to take up his role as the family head. Thus, when the cheque arrives she decides first what to do with it \u2014buy a house at Clybourne Park and move the family into a more decent accommodation and environment, Walter's disagreement notwithstanding. With the cheque, she is able to satisfy her children's dreams, including Ruth's and even Travis's. By allowing Walter Jr. to disburse the rest of the money, she restores her faith in her son: \"it ain't much but it's all I got in the world and I'm putting it in your hands. I'm telling you to be the head of the family from now on like you supposed to be\".\nRuth represents a different class of women who will stand up to men when they are wrong. Thus it is not all that Walter, her husband, says that she takes. For instance, when Walter responds to her question, \"what kind of eggs you want?\" with \"not scrambled\", she immediately begins scrambling the eggs. Another example is her defying her husband's opposition to her intended abortion. Thanks to Mama. Ruth changes her mind. But Ruth is still a conventional woman of sorts. She is not entirely happy about Beneatha's new found life-style and beliefs. The scene where Mama disciplines Beneatha for her heretical comments about God reveals an aspect of Ruth's character. After Mama is gone, she chides Beneatha for behaving like a child. Then, when Beneatha walks out, she goes to Mania and says to her: \"she said she was sorry\". Ruth will do everything she can to preserve the family unity. Regardihg the movement to Clybourne Park, she gives her consent: As she puts it, \"... if this is my time in life to say goodbye .. (then) good-bye misery... I don't never want to see your ugly face again!\" This demonstrates the family's yearning to improve their status. Beneatha alone stands for change. Her desire is to pursue education and become a doctor. This challenges the conventional role of the African American woman who is not expected to aspire to professions reserved for men. Even when men try to exert power on Beneatha and belittle her, she remains resolute. The hair incident is an example. When George tells her to 'drop the Garbo routine' because he does. not want `to hear all about (her) thoughts', she. refuses to be belittled and asks him 'Then why read books? Why go to school?' She is aghast at his answer \"... you need books.., to get grades \u2014 to pass the course \u2014 to get. a degree. That's all \u2014 it has nothing to do with thoughts\".\nBeneatha mulls over this and decides that George is a fool and will not waste her time on a fool. Beneatha, like her mother and Ruth, cannot believe that Walter has staked the rest of the insurance money on a deal that goes wrong. Unlike them, however, she pours contempt on him\u2014 'I look at you and I see the final triumph of stupidity in the world', adding that Walter is not a man; \"he is nothing but a toothless rat\". But when her mother admonishes her, saying that \"the time to love somebody the most ... is when he's at his lowest and can't believe it hisself. .` Beneatha readily takes that to heart. Later, after Walter tells Mr. Lindner through much fumbling on his part, that the family has refused Lindner's offer and will move into their house, Beneatha is the first to support Walter. When a stupefied Lindner says to the family 'I take it then that you have decided to occupy' it is Beneatha who quickly responds 'That's what the man said. Walter, Whom she earlier said, was not a man' is the very 'man' she confidentely refers to, because she sees him rise to his duty \"like a rainbow after the rain'.\nPoints to note:\n(1) The characteristion of Mama as matriarch of the family. Her taking over responsibility as head after her husband's death; her offer of love even when there are cracks in the family fold; her use of the insurance money to buy a house at Clybourne Park; her ceding control over the family to Walter after he has come into his own.\n(2) Ruth's portrayal as a not so conventional woman in her relationship with Walter; her ability to express her feeling openly to Mama, her acting Mama's confidant; her pleasure in moving out of misery to Clybourne Park.\n(3) Beneatha's portrayal as the unconventional black American woman, educated and aspiring to become a doctor. Her intolerance of mediocrity in men who would put her down and her emotional and psychological affinity to men like Asagai. She too is happy to move to Clybourne Park.",

    "correct_answer": "The poem is about the clash of cultures and the major symbols are the drums, on the one hand, and the piano on the other. Each represents the African and the Western culture respectively. The minor symbols are drawn from flora and fauna. The persona recalls the 'jungle drums telegraphing the mystic rhythm\" to symbolise the simplicity, not only of rural life, but also of authentic African culture.\nIt is the sound of these drums that excites in hint nostalgic feelings of the good old days in the \"mother's laps a suckling\". The sound also evokes memories of the rustic village life of that time and age as captured by the pastoral image of the hunters crouching \"with spears poised\". The animal image of \"the leopard snarling about to leap\" and the floral image of \"green\u00a0leaves and wild flowers\" evoke fear and beauty.\nThe sound of the drums also enables the persona to recall the simplicity of that era when \"paths with no innovations\" were \"fashioned\" with the \"naked/warmth of hurrying feet\". The language associated with this drum symbol has warmth, vivacity and vitality, which reveals the persona's bias towards African culture. The other major symbol is the piano \u2014 \"the wailing piano\" \u2014 which stands for the new complex and alien culture and its mechanical sophistication.\nPhrases used to describe this are \"tear-furrowed concerto\", \"coaxing diminuendo, counterpoint and crescendo\".The language associated with this symbol of the piano is doeful e.g. wailing piano, and one the persona is unable to identify with. Nevertheless, the two symbols \u2014 the 'jungle drums\" and the \"wailing piano\" \u2014forge a new consciousness that the persona is unable to deal with. That is his labyrinth.\nPoints to note:\n(1) Symbolism is representation of an abstract idea or thing by concrete objects. Piano and Drums are the key symbols.\n(2) The images associated with the drums are evoking, idyllic/pastoral setting.\n(3) The images associated with the piano invoking artificiality, sophistication and even sorrow.\n(4) The poet's complex attitude towards both symbols.",

    "text": "NON-AFRICAN POETRY\n\u00a0\nComment on the use of pun in Herberts the Pulley?",
    "options": {},
    "answer_url": "https://myschool.ng/classroom/literature-in-english/50575?exam_type=waec&type=theory&page=8",
    "correct_answer": "\"The Pulley\" is a poem about God's love for mankind and His concern that man is never separated from Him. According to Herbert's narrative, which is interspersed with God's own direct speech, God, at the beginning of creation, blessed man with the \"world's riches\" poured from his \"glass of blessings\". These are named in the second stanza as \"strength\", \"beautie\", \"wisdome\", \"honour\", \"pleasure\", in that order, except one, \"rest\" which lay in the bottom of his glass. This visual image of \"a glass of blessings\" demonstrates God's benevolence. The meaning of the poem is basically anchored on the word \"rest\" whose several meanings constitute the literary device called \"pun\", loosely defined as \"a play on words\". Indeed the first pun on \"rest\" gives it the meaning of contentment. From God's own perspective, if He should bestow 'rest' on His creature, man, the latter's contentment alone will separate him from God and he will \"rest in nature, not the God of nature\", and thus \"adore my gifts instead of me\". Here a related meaning of 'rest' is being played on, which is \"abide in\", alongside being \"content with\".\nThe second pun on \"rest\" invests the word with the meaning \"other(s)\" referring to the \"worldly riches\" God has already bestowed on man. By withholding the gift of \"rest\" God, nevertheless intends that man should enjoy \"the rest\" \u2014 His other gifts, yet 'rest' withheld generates restlessness in man, its exact opposite. This time, the pun on \"rest\" includes its\u00a0opposite \u2014 restlessness. The latter is reinforced by God's choice of modifier, \u2014 \"repining\" to produce \"repining restlessness\".\nThe implication or suggestion is that God goes to great length to draw man back to Himself (as a pulley does) by creating in the latter an ennui that is never satisfied. This is the result of the \"rest\" that God withholds from man among the rest of the gifts bestowed. God's arrangement then ensures that if man's inclination to do good does not bring him close enough to God, \"weariness\" induced by \"repining restlessness\" will \"toss him to my breast\". It can be concluded then that pun plays a crucial role in unravelling the meaning of the poem.\nPoints to note:\n(1) The interpretation of pun and its relevance to the theme.\n(2) Pun on 'rest' as contentment.\n(3) Pun on 'rest' as remainder/other.\n(4) Relationship of 'rest' to the thematic concerns of the poem.",

    "options": {},
    "answer_url": "https://myschool.ng/classroom/literature-in-english/50576?exam_type=waec&type=theory&page=8",
    "correct_answer": "The poem is about birches, trees that grow in temperate regions and are noted for their resilience. The poet describes a situation in which the trees are bent either by a boy swinging them, or by nature through the effect of snow and ice-storms. Details of the ravages brought upon the trees are provided as they click 'crash' under the snow until summer when the warmth of the sun melts the snow and enables them to rise again. Even so, they are cut and loaded off as timber.\nThe emphasis throughout the poem is on the resilience of the trees, whether they are bent by humans or by nature itself And in spite of the fact that they never right themselves to their former heights, they never fall never to rise \"years afterwards\", as their trunks arch in the woods attractively, like girls' hair tossed \"before them over their heads to dry\".\nThe poet even recalls a memorable incident of some boy that had taken to swinging birches, and taken care not to swing too low to lose hold as the trees swing back. He remembers his own childhood experience too. The very fact of the experience is not lost upon the poet. Indeed the resilience of the trees provides a lesson for his own determination to endure life the way birches do. Their supple frame enables them to endure what both man and nature do to them. And that is the lesson of endurance the poet learns from the observation of and experience with swinging the trees.\nPoints to note:\n(a) The havoc wreaked on the birch trees by snow and ice storms which bend them.\n(b) The resilience of the birch trees as they lie or bend.\n(c) The swinging of birch trees for sport by \"some boy\" and the speaker, illustrating their ability to withstand abuse.\n(d) The lesson the speaker learns about the birch trees through observation and experience.",
