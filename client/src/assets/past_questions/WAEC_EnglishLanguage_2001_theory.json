How are you and your course? I hope that everything is going fine. The main purpose of writing you this letter is to tell you how we have all been faring in Nigeria since you left for the United States of America.\nAs you know, before you left the country, I was attending Federal Government Girls' College, Ibussa, Delta State. Since we moved from Delta State to Lagos, Mum transferred me to Queen's College and Olu to Command Children's School in Victoria Island. At first, I couldn't really cope educationally but now I have improved tremendously.\nYour little Dupe also took the National Entrance Examination in primary five and scored 545 marks. We were all very happy and Mum decided to take us out for a celebration dinner. We went to The Peninsula which is a very nice restaurant and had a good meal. She finally got admission into the Nigerian Navy Secondary School, Ojo. She is now in JSS 1 and she is doing very fine.\nDaddy, Aunty Yemi has eventually secured a job at Chevron. Her appointment as a computer programmer at the oil company has helped us to know how powerfully God works. I know that you can still remember how Aunty\u00a0Yemi struggled very hard to secure a job after her graduation. She now earns a good salary which makes it easy for her to help mummy in some areas.\nIn addition to this, Mummy has been promoted in her office. She is now the chief accountant and she is about to complete her master's degree at the University of Lagos. She has also opened another shop in addition to the big one she had. She is selling computer accessories in this shop and I learnt that she supplies computer accessories to reputable companies. She earns good money from this business which makes us comfortable.\nDaddy, guess what! The uncompleted building which you left behind has been completed. The building was completed last month with a little change in the design and plan that you left behind. It is now a duplex with spacious parking space, a small garden and an orchard in its backyard. The house has sliding doors and windows and it is painted yellow.\nBesides this, mummy has bought a brand new Mercedes Benz car and a Toyota 14-seater bus which is used to convey us to school every day. Daddy, never be disturbed because the family is doing very well. I know that you will have completed your course in two years' time. We shall be looking forward to welcoming you back home. Convey my sincere greetings to your colleagues and friends. Mummy sends her greetings.Yours sincerely,Tolu.",

    "correct_answer": "THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THE EXTENDED FAMILY SYSTEMBefore I go on to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the system, it is pertinent to describe what is meant by the extended family system. The extended family is much larger than the nuclear family which is sometimes known as the simple, or immediate family. The nuclear family consists of a man and his wife or wives and any number of children they may have while the extended family may include three or four generations of relatives.\nThe extended family system is practised mainly in African countries. The extended family system has some advantages as well as disadvantages. First and foremost, the extended family system offers a child the opportunity to relate to as many relatives as he or she wants. Since a child grows and develops within the family system, a child growing within a larger extended family is open to many values and qualities from which he can learn.\nSecondly, the child receives attention from various people outside his immediate or nuclear family. He has many relations doting on him and he acquires more gifts and benefits than a child who has his immediate family to depend on. If he is ill, he has many people to attend to him and he is loved by many people.\u00a0In case of the sudden death of any of his parents, the child in the extended family system has some other people to take care of him. In the system, a widow does not suffer. She is taken care of and her children are also taken care of by every member of the extended family. Lastly, a child learns to be friendly, trusting and cooperative in the extended family system. The system makes it easy for a child to relate with other people in a larger society because the system\u00a0would have given him a wider outlook which cannot be obtained within the narrow nuclear family system.\nHowever, the extended family system could lead to disunity among members of the family if there is a quarrel or disagreement. It is very difficult to manage crises or quarrels within the extended family. Unlike the nuclear family system where the head of the family can easily reconcile two bickering members of the family, it is often difficult to do so in the extended family system. The extended family system is always very difficult to coordinate together.\nThe system could also cause jealousy and unhealthy rivalry among its members. If any member of the family is progressing more than others, there may arise envy and hatred against the person especially if he tries to dominate other members. In Africa, such rivalry and envy could go to the extent of envious people consulting herbalists and charms to hurt one another.\nThe success of the extended family system depends on the operators of the system. It could be a place of respite if there is love and unity among members of the extended family but it could be a hateful system if it is allowed to engender bickering and petty jealousy.\nYemi Oloko,SS 3B.",

Secondary schools were closed down for over six months across the nation and within that period the nation's educational development came to a standstill. Secondary school students roamed about and many died while engaging themselves in fruitless adventures as teachers were adamant to go back to the classrooms.\u00a0However. we must begin to look at ways by which future strike actions could be averted and prevented. I, therefore, wish to offer some suggestions on how to prevent strike actions in our secondary schools.\nFirst and foremost, secondary school teachers should be adequately remunerated They deserve to be paid good salaries because of their importance in our educational system. Sir, I believe that they should be equally remunerated as their colleagues in the ministries and other government parastatals. They should also be given other benefits and emoluments as other civil servants in the ministries.\nSecondly, secondary school teachers' salaries should be paid on time. I remember that one of the grievances of these teachers before they embarked on the last nationwide strike was that their salaries were not paid on time It seems as if secondary school teachers are always at the receiving end whenever the government is unable to pay salaries as at when due. They complained that they always received their salaries two or three weeks after their colleagues in the ministries had received theirs.\nIn addition to this, secondary school teachers should be given good conditions of service. One of their grievances is that the condition of the schools is deplorable. Therefore one of the ways to prevent future strike actions is to build modern classroom blocks that are adequately furnished with modern facilities. This will give a conducive atmosphere for the teachers to teach.\nI would be grateful if you could look into all these suggestions so that we could have peaceful academic sessions in our secondary schools nationwide.

I am here to support the motion which says: \"Civilian rule is better than military rule.\"\nFirstly, I would like to take the pains to enlighten some of the younger ones here about what civilian rule and\u00a0military rule are actually all about. Civilian rule can be likened to a democratic rule. Democracy, in the opinion of the layman, is government for the people, of the people and by the people. From the definition, it can be noted that civilian rulers are actually chosen by the people and they work for the benefit of the people who choose them.\u00a0On the other hand, military rule can be likened to an autocratic rule where the people are instructed to go and come without any argument from anyone. It is like a do-or-die affair. Let me now get down to the motion.\nFirst and foremost, in every democratic dispensation, there is freedom to vote and be voted for, which is not present in military rule. The civilians only rule when they have been elected by the people. They do not impose themselves on anyone. Meanwhile, the people have no say when the military is ruling. Military rule is imposed on the people and military heads of state rule without the consent of the people. Because military men have guns, the people can not protest, they just have to accept them.\nMoreover, when civilians rule, the people enjoy freedom of speech and of the press. An indigene can criticise a civilian leader either in the newspaper or on television without any fear of molestation. Nowadays, it is very common to see people criticising or admonishing the civilian president of Nigeria on television. Everybody is believed to be equal under a civilian dispensation. However, in military rule, no one has the guts to talk against a ruler even in the enclosure of his room because walls are believed to have ears.\nFurthermore, in military rule, some innocent citizens, being victims of circumstances, are shot down accidentally. This often occurs in a military dispensation. There is little respect or regard for human lives and the military can be likened to armed robbers because instead of using their guns for security purposes, they maim innocent lives. However, in civilian rule, intimidating guns are not present and this actually brings a sense of security to the citizens.\nLastly, civilian rulers execute good and popular projects which are aimed at ameliorating the suffering of the people they rule. They know that the people who vote them into power will judge them by their performance. Therefore, they execute good projects and provide infrastructural facilities that could speak for them when they are called to render account of their stewardship in governance. On the contrary, military rulers are not guided by the wishes and demands of the people they rule when it comes to project execution. This is because they are not accountable to the people.\nI believe that I have been able to convince you that civilian rule is better than military rule. I thank you for your patience.",

By his side, reading a magazine was his first son, a twenty-year-old university computer science student. On the man\u2019s mind was the contract he was pursuing in the capital city. It was worth several million dollars. Although he had handled bigger contracts before, Bitrus was preoccupied with this new challenge, his mind far away from the road before him. His son was also buried in the magazine\u00a0he was reading. So neither saw the goat crossing the road early enough. Like an automaton,\u00a0\u00a0Bitrus jammed on the brakes. In a flash, there was a skid and a somersault. The villagers worked for almost an hour on the huge Mercedes before rescuing the two.\u00a0\nThere, in the casualty ward, the duo lay on the stretchers. Bitrus was soon in a fairly stable, but anybody would know that the son needed prompt\u00a0specialist medical attention. The doctor was sent for, a surgeon who regularly handled such cases. Soon enough, the doctor came. The nurses heaved a sigh of relief. But then... \u201cOh no, I can\u2019t handle this case. He\u2019s my son!\u201d Everyone was shocked. One of the nurses pleaded. \u201cBut doctor, you must do something otherwise,... \u201cNo, he\u2019s my son. I\u2019ll have to transfer this case.\u201d And so tearfully, more agitated\u00a0than anybody around, the doctor hurried away to call a colleague.\u00a0\n\nHere was Bitrus, with multiple injuries, but not in danger. In the adjoining room was his son, still comatose. How then could a doctor come in and say, \u201cThis is my son\u201d? Wasn\u2019t Bitrus the father after all? Most\u00a0people would reason that the doctor was truly the secret biological father. Others, reasoning hard, would conclude that the doctor was Bitrus\u2019s father and thus was right in describing him as his son. But for how long would people continue to think that all doctors must be male? Couldn\u2019t the doctor have simply been Mrs. Bitrus?\u00a0\n\n(a) (i) What was the remote cause of the accident? (ii) What was the immediate cause?\u00a0\n(b) What does the passage suggest about doctors\u2019 attitude to the cases they handle?\u00a0\n(c) Describe the conditions of Mr. Bitrus and his son at the hospital.\u00a0\n(d) What assumption about doctors does the passage illustrate?\u00a0\n(e) His son was also buried in the magazine he was reading.\u00a0\n(i) What type of figurative expression is this? (ii) What is its function as it is used in the sentence?\u00a0\n(f) ...that the doctor was truly the secret biological father.\u00a0\n(i) What grammatical name is given to this expression? (ii) What is its function as it is used in the sentence?\u00a0\n(g) For each of the following, find a word or phrase that means the same and can replace it as it is used in the passage: (i) oblivious (ii) prompt (iii) regularly (iv) pleaded (v) agitated (vi) adjoining",

    "text": "Read the following passage carefully and\u00a0answer the questions on it.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s undergraduates\u00a0did not need to apply for employment.\u00a0Employees usually wooed them by\u00a0depositing offers of jobs in their halls of\u00a0residence for those interested to pick and\u00a0choose from as soon as they finished\u00a0writing their degree examinations. How\u00a0things have changed! We have since\u00a0\u201cprogressed\u201d from this age of abundance\u00a0in which unemployment was hardly\u00a0heard\u00a0of to one of economic recession and\u00a0widespread unemployment. The problem\u00a0is so acute that one finds unemployment\u00a0even among engineers and doctors.\nWhat are the causes of this\u00a0phenomenon? For one thing, our\u00a0educational system does not train its\u00a0products for self-employment. Everybody\u00a0expects the government or the private sector to provide them with a job at the\u00a0end of their studies. As we have now\u00a0realised, the\u00a0government and the private\u00a0sector combined cannot create enough\u00a0jobs to go around the army of graduates\u00a0turned out annually by our universities.\u00a0For another, many parents encourage\u00a0their children to enrol in courses leading\u00a0to prestigious and lucrative professions\u00a0for which they may be intellectually\u00a0unsuited. They end up obtaining poor\u00a0degrees or none at all. Such graduates cannot compete in the job market, so\u00a0they swell the ranks of the unemployable\u00a0and the unemployed.\nPerhaps the most important single cause\u00a0of unemployment is economic recession.\u00a0During\u00a0periods of boom, economic\u00a0activities are generated in abundance\u00a0and these make plenty of jobs available.\u00a0But the reverse is the case in times of\u00a0economic recession.\nThere is no simple solution to the\u00a0problem. Everyone in the society has a\u00a0role to play here. The government has a\u00a0duty to ensure that the economy is\u00a0buoyant, thus providing the right\u00a0environment for the creation of jobs. The\u00a0educational authorities have to orientate\u00a0the process of education towards the\u00a0production of job creators rather than job\u00a0seekers.\u00a0Guidance and counselling services\u00a0should\u00a0be made available in all secondary\u00a0institutions. Parents, too, should stop\u00a0misdirecting their children into choosing\u00a0careers for which they are ill-suited.\n(a)(i) What was the employment\u00a0situation like in the 1960s and 1970s?\n(ii) What is the situation now?\n(b) In what ways do the education\u00a0systems, the parents and the students\u00a0contribute to the\u00a0unemployment\u00a0situation?\n(c) Mention three suggestions given in\u00a0the last paragraph for solving the\u00a0problem.\n(d) Why does the writer enclose the word\u00a0progressed (First paragraph) in quotation\u00a0marks?\n(e) ........for which they may be\u00a0intellectually unsuited.\n(i) What grammatical name is given\u00a0to this expression?\n(ii)What is its function as it is used\u00a0in the sentence?\n(f) For each of the following words, find\u00a0another word or phrase that means the\u00a0same and can replace it as it is used in\u00a0the passage:\n(i) recession\n(ii) acute\n(iii) army\n(iv) lucrative\n(v) boom\n(vi) orientate",

    "text": "Read the following passage carefully and\u00a0answer, in your own words as far as\u00a0possible, the question that follows.\nPoverty! Can anyone who has not really\u00a0been poor know what poverty is? I really\u00a0doubt it.\u00a0How can anyone who enjoys\u00a0three square meals a day explain what\u00a0poverty means? Indeed can\u00a0someone\u00a0who has two full meals a day claim to\u00a0know poverty? Perhaps, one begins to\u00a0grasp the full meaning of poverty when\u00a0one struggles really hard to have one\u00a0miserable meal in twenty-four hours. Poverty and hunger are cousins, the\u00a0former always dragging along the latter\u00a0wherever he chooses to go.\nIf you were wearing a suit, or a complete\u00a0traditional attire, and you look naturally\u00a0rotund in your apparel, you cannot\u00a0understand what poverty entails. Nor can\u00a0you have a true feel of poverty if you\u00a0have some good shirts and pairs of\u00a0trousers, never mind that all these are\u00a0casual wear. Indeed, if you can change\u00a0one dress into another, and these are all\u00a0you can boast of, you are not really poor. A person begins to have a true feel of\u00a0what poverty means when, apart from the\u00a0tattered clothes on\u00a0his body, he doesn\u2019t\u00a0have any other; not even a calico sheet to keep\u00a0away the cold at night.\nLet us face it, how can anyone who has never\u00a0slept outside, in the open, appreciate the\u00a0full, harsh import of homelessness? Yet\u00a0that is what real, naked poverty is. He\u00a0who can lay claim to a house,\u00a0however\u00a0humble, cannot claim to be poor. Indeed,\u00a0if he can afford to rent a flat, or a room in\u00a0town or city, without the landlord having\u00a0cause to eject him, he cannot honestly\u00a0claim to be poor. The really poor man has\u00a0no roof over his head, and this is why you\u00a0find him under a bridge, in a tent or\u00a0simply in the vast open air.\u00a0\nBut that is hardly all. The poor man faces\u00a0the world as a hopeless underdog. In\u00a0every bargain, every discussion, every\u00a0event involving him and others, the poor\u00a0man is constantly reminded of his failure\u00a0in life. Nobody listens attentively when he\u00a0makes a point, nobody accepts that his\u00a0opinion merits consideration. So in most\u00a0cases, he learns to accept that he has\u00a0neither wisdom nor opinion.\nThe pauper\u2019s lot naturally rubs off on his\u00a0child who is subject not only to hunger of\u00a0the body but also of the mind. The pauper\u00a0lacks the resources to send his child to\u00a0school. And even in\u00a0communities where\u00a0education is free, the pauper\u2019s child still\u00a0faces an uphill task because the hunger of the body impedes the proper\u00a0nourishment of the mind.\u00a0Denied access to modern communications media, the poor child has very little opportunity to understand the concepts taught him. His mind is rocky soil on which the teacher\u2019s seeds cannot easily germinate. Thus embattled at home and then at school, the pauper\u2019s child soon has very little option but to drop out of school.\u00a0\nThat is still not all. Weakened by hunger, embattled by cold and exposure to the elements, feeding on poor water and poor food, the pauper is an easy target for diseases. This is precisely why the poorest countries have the shortest life expectancy while the longest life expectancies\u00a0are recorded among the richest countries. Poverty is really a disease that shortens life!\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(a)In six sentences, one for each, summarize the problems of the poor man.",
