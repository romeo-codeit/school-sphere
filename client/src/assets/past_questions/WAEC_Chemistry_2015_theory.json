    "explanation": "(a) Definition of Electrochemical Cell: Electrochemical cell is defined as a device/cell which converts chemical energy to electrical energy/or electricity is generated by a chemical change.\n(b) Aluminium can be prepared commercially by the application of electrolysis:\n(i) Name the: I. Electrolyte used in the process: (i) Aluminium oxide/(Molten) alumina. II. Bauxite. III. Carbon electrodes/graphite electrodes.\n(ii) Reasons why cryolite, NaAl F\\(_6\\) is added to the electrolyte: \u2013As a solvent. \u2013Helps reduce the melting point of alumina (Al\\(_2\\)O\\(_3\\)). \u2013To increase the conductivity of electrolyte.\n(c)(i) Gaseous fuels produced from coke: \u2013Producer gas. \u2013Water gas.\n(c)(ii) Water gas.\n(iii) Reason for your answer in(c)(ii): The producer gas contains about 67%/More non-combustible nitrogen and 33% less combustible carbon (II) oxide while water gas contains equal amount of combustible carbon (II) oxide and hydrogen.\n(iv) Balance equation for each production of gaseous fuel: Producer gas. 2C\\(_{(s)}\\) + O2\\(_{2(g)}\\) + 4N\\(_{2(g)}\\) --> 2CO\\(_{(g)}\\) +4N\\(_{2(g)}\\). Water gas: C\\(_{(s)}\\) + H\\(_{2}\\)O \u2014> CO\\(_{(g)}\\) + H\\(_{2(g)}\\)\n(d)(i) What would be observed when:\nI. Chlorine gas is bubbled through aqueous sodium iodide. \u2013Colourless solution turn reddish brown.\nII. Chlorine gas is passed over heated iron in a hard glass tube. \u2013Grey silvery solid turns brown.\nIII. Aqueous silver trioxonitrate (V) is added to aqueous sodium bromide. \u2013Cream/(pale) yellow precipitate.\n(ii) Chemical equation for reactions in (d)(i):\n(i) Cl\\(_2\\) +2Nal ---> 2NaCl + l\\(_2\\)\n(ii) 2Fe +3Cl\\(_{2}\\) \u2014> 2FeCl\\(_{2}\\)\n(iii) AgNO\\(_{3}\\) +NaBr \u2014> NaNO\\(_3\\) + AgBr.",
