Adam is told that the ground is cursed because of him, and he will toil in labour to eat from it, dealing with thorns and thistles, and earning his bread by the sweat of his face until he returns to dust. These curses symbolize the introduction of hardship, pain and mortality into the world as a consequence of sin.",

    "explanation": "1samuel 15:1-33\nBecauseyou haverejectedthe word of the LORD,Healso hasrejectedyou from beingking: In his empty religious practice, rebellion, and stubbornness against God,Saul rejected God\u2019sword. So, God rightlyrejectedhimas king over Israel.Saul was rejected as king not specifically because he offered sacrifices, but because he disobeyed a direct command that God had given him through the prophet Samuel. Samuel had told Saul, \u201cGo down ahead of me to Gilgal.\nI will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, but you mustwait seven daysuntil I come to you and tell you what you are to do.\u201d\u00a0 But Saul, worried that his whole army would desert him, offered the sacrifices himself, just before Samuel arrived.\n\u201cYou have done a foolish thing,\u201d Samuel told him. \u201cYou have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. But now your kingdom will not endure; the Lord has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him ruler of his people,because you have not kept the Lord\u2019s command.\u201d\u00a0 In other words, the penalty for this outright disobedience to a direct command from God was that Saul would not be the founder of a royal dynasty; while he would remain king, his descendants would not rule after him.\nSecondarily, however, this disobedience did lead Saul to usurp a privilege of the priesthood. By offering these sacrifices, Saul was imitating the Canaanite priest-king model instead of respecting the separation between the kingship and the priesthood that was established in the law of Moses.\nSaul subsequently disobeyed another direct command from God when he was told, again through the prophet Samuel, to completelydestroy the Amalekites.*\u00a0 Saul instead kept their king, Agag, alive as a trophy of war, and his soldiers kept the best of the cattle to \u201csacrifice to the Lord\u201d\u2014as part of a grand feast that they would enjoy themselves.\u00a0 Samuel asked Saul once again, \u201cWhy did you not obey the Lord?\u201d\u00a0 The penalty for outright disobedience this time was that Saul would not even remain king himself for his natural lifetime; he would die early and be succeeded by \u201cone of his neighbors\u201d\u2014not one of his own descendants.",

    "explanation": "The New Testament accounts indicate that the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus took place around the time of the Jewish festival of Passover. According to the Gospels, Jesus was arrested, crucified, and buried shortly before the Passover.\nThe Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 26:17-19, 27:45-50, 28:1-7), for example, states that Jesus was crucified on the day of Preparation, which is commonly understood to be the day before Passover. The Gospel of Mark (Mark 14:12-16, 15:25, 16:1-7), the Gospel of Luke (Luke 22:7-23, 23:44-46, 24:1-7), and the Gospel of John (John 18:28, 19:14-16, 19:31, 20:1-18) also associate Jesus' death and resurrection with the Passover season.",
