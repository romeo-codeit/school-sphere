    "explanation": "Demand-pull inflation is an inflation caused by excess demand. This happens when\u00a0demand outweighs\u00a0supply. To curtail\u00a0demand pull inflation, governments\u00a0and central banks would have to implement a tight monetary and fiscal policy. Examples include increasing the interest rate or lowering government spending or raising taxes.\nBy increasing interest rates, lowering government spending or raising taxes,\u00a0the government will be taking out the excess money in circulation.\nWith high interest rates, people would rather save and invest their monies rather than spend it since it attracts high interest. This will take out the excess money in circulation in the economy, reduce people spending power.",

If\u00a0inflation\u00a0increases more than\u00a0income,\u00a0real income\u00a0will go down. If\u00a0inflation\u00a0decreases and\u00a0income\u00a0stays the same, then\u00a0real income\u00a0goes up.",
