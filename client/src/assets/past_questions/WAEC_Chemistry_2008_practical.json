Effervescence occurred and a gas R was given off which turned lime water milky. Excess Q was removed from the mixture. The solution of Cu\\(_2\\)SO\\(_4\\)\u00a0was concentrated to half its original volume and allowed to stand.\n(i) What is substance Q?\n(ii) Name gas R\n(ii) Why was excess Q used?\n(iv) How would you know that the reaction is complete?\n(v) What method was used to remove excess Q? (vi) Why was the solution of CusO\\(_4\\)\u00a0not heated to dryness?\n(b) Name the reagent(s) used for testing each of the following substances in the laboratory: (i) Water; (i) Primary alkanol.",
