The dielectric material between the plates is a non-conducting material, which means it does not allow the flow of electric current. Therefore, in a DC circuit, where current is the flow of charge over time, current cannot flow through the dielectric.

Similarly, when ball Q is thrown vertically upward, it initially moves upward but is also under the influence of gravity, which acts to slow it down and eventually makes it fall back down.Both balls, P and Q, are subjected to the same acceleration due to gravity (assuming no other forces are acting on them), which is approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2 near the surface of the Earth, and this acceleration acts in the downward direction.
