Sonar is commonly used in marine navigation, fishing, and underwater mapping.- Medical Imaging: In medical ultrasound imaging, echoes are used to create images of the interior of the body. High-frequency sound waves are directed into the body, and the echoes that bounce back from different tissues are used to generate detailed images of organs, blood vessels, and developing fetuses during pregnancy.- Architectural Design: Architects and engineers use echoes to evaluate the acoustics of buildings and design spaces with optimal sound qualities. The controlled use of echoes can enhance the sound in concert halls, auditoriums, and theaters, providing a more enjoyable listening experience for audiences.- Geological Surveys: Seismic surveys use echoes generated by controlled explosions or mechanical sources to map subsurface geological features. By analyzing the time it takes for seismic waves to reflect off different rock layers, geologists can infer the composition and structure of the Earth's subsurface.- Surveying and Distance Measurement: Echoes are used in surveying and distance measurement equipment like total stations and laser rangefinders.
