    "explanation": "Using the formula, \\((n - 2) \\times 180\u00b0\\) to get the sum of the interior angles. Then we can have\n\\((n - 2) \\times 180\u00b0 = 108n\\) ... (1)\n\\((n - 2) \\times 180\u00b0 = 116n\\) ... (2)\n\\((n - 2) \\times 180\u00b0 = 120n\\) ... (3)\nSolving the above given equations, where n is not a positive integer then that angle is not the interior for a regular polygon.\n(1): \\(180n - 360 = 108n \\implies 72n = 360\\)\n\\(n = 5\\) (regular pentagon)\n(2): \\(180n - 360 = 116n \\implies 64n = 360\\)\n\\(n = 5.625\\)\n(3): \\(180n\u00a0- 360 = 120n \\implies 60n = 360\\)\n\\(n = 6\\) (regular hexagon)\nHence, 116\u00b0 is not an angle of a regular polygon.",
