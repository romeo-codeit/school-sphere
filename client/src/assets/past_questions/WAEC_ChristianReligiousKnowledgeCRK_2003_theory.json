Apostle Paul wrote a letter seeking forgiveness for his runaway slave to Philemon. Since Paul converted Philemon, he would have expected him to oblige his request and abide by his will, but because of his conviction it would be wrong to assume such authority over his spiritual son, ( Philemon). He rather preferred to write him not as a command but with a spirit of love and persuasion, on behalf of Onesimus who had become his (Paul's) own son in Christ. His letter was necessary since Onesimus has become a born-again Christian. Paul taught it wise to send Onesimus back to Philemon with love. Ordinarily he would have liked to retain Onesimus as his assistant, but he rather opted to send him to his master. Since it was Paul's strong conviction that Onesimus\u00a0departure from Philemon was for his moral and spiritual growth,now that forgiveness is in place there would be permanent reconciliation between Master and slave. Onesimus would now be accepted back as a Christian brother not as a slave.Paul believed that if Philemon still regarded him as a true Christian partner and brother, he should extend a similar regard to Onesimus and accepted his claim to undertake all outstanding bills that Onesimus must have owed him, with the view to paying them. Paul believed that if his plea to Philemon for Onesimus should succeed he would be spiritually refreshed.",
    "explanation": "Paul believed that Philemon's slave, Onesimus, had run away, with goods stolen from his master and later sought refuge in Rome where he met Paul in prison. Apostle Paul wrote a letter seeking forgiveness for his runaway slave to Philemon. Since Paul converted Philemon, he would have expected him to oblige his request and abide by his will, but because of his conviction it would be wrong to assume such authority over his spiritual son, ( Philemon). He rather preferred to write him not as a command but with a spirit of love and persuasion, on behalf of Onesimus who had become his (Paul's) own son in Christ. His letter was necessary since Onesimus has become a born-again Christian. Paul taught it wise to send Onesimus back to Philemon with love. Ordinarily he would have liked to retain Onesimus as his assistant, but he rather opted to send him to his master. Since it was Paul's strong conviction that Onesimus\u00a0departure from Philemon was for his moral and spiritual growth,now that forgiveness is in place there would be permanent reconciliation between Master and slave. Onesimus would now be accepted back as a Christian brother not as a slave.Paul believed that if Philemon still regarded him as a true Christian partner and brother, he should extend a similar regard to Onesimus and accepted his claim to undertake all outstanding bills that Onesimus must have owed him, with the view to paying them. Paul believed that if his plea to Philemon for Onesimus should succeed he would be spiritually refreshed.",

    "correct_answer": "(a) Since the hope of Glory that awaits the Christian was enormous because of the resurrection from the death of Jesus, Paul exhorts them to rejoice. He adviced them not to lay claim to the present life which might be limited by trials and persecution, since such trials are mere test of their faith. According to him, they should have confidence in the fact Jesus himself passed through greater suffering than they were passing through.\nTheir suffering will make them reap the great reward of salvation when Jesus is revealed to them. For them to gain Insight\u00a0of this hope (of salvation) they should live holy lives, having the knowledge that God, the impartial Judge, would reward their suffering.\nHe equally stated that if they are cursed for the sake of Christ, they shall count themselves blessed since they are not suffering as murderers, thieves or for any wrong-doing, they should glorify God for their tribulation. According to Paul, if judgement would begin in the church, the fate of the unbelievers would be unbearable.\n(b) Christians should desist from the carnal nature of the men of this world.They should remain sober expectant of the salvation and glory that would be theirs when Jesus shall be revealed to them. Total submission and reverence to God should guard them jealously since God is an important judge. They should be steadfast in their Christian faith, and refused to be shaken by the cares of this world and the machination of the enemy, giving praises to God in bad times and in the season of Joy should always be part of their lives.",
