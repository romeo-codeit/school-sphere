    "explanation": "(a)(i) Mass defect is the difference between the mass of a nucleus and the total mass of its nucleons. It expressed in atomic mass unit (a.m.u.). It is also a measure of binding energy.\nMass defect = total mass of nucleus\n\u2013 mass of nucleons.\n(ii) Binding energy is the work done or energy needed to separate the nucleons in a nucleus. It is measured in eV or Joules (J).\n(b)(i) The effect of decreasing the speed of a photoelectron on: (\\(\\alpha\\)) wavelength --> wavelength increases. (\\(\\beta\\)) energy ---> energy decreases.\n(ii) \\(\\lambda = \\frac{h}{mv}\\)\n= \\(\\frac{6.6 \\times 10^{-34}}{4.4 \\times 10^{-2} \\times 10^{-16}}\\)m\n(c) Pairs of isotopes in the figure are;\n\\(^{208}_{82}Pb\\) and \\(^{212}_{82}Pb\\) or \\(^{212}_{84}Po\\) and \\(^{216}_{84}Po\\) or\n\\(^{224}_{88}Ra\\) and \\(^{288}_{88}Ra\\) or \\(^{288}_{90}Th\\) and \\(^{232}_{90}Th\\)\n(ii) The series started with isotopes \\(^{232}_{90}Th\\)\n(iii) Nuclear equation for;\n\\(\\alpha\\)Alpha decay\n\\(^{232}_{90}Th\\)\u00a0 \\(\\to\\) \\(^{228}_{88}Ra\\)\u00a0 + \\(^{4}_{2}He\\) + Energy;\n\\(^{228}_{90}Th\\)\u00a0 \\(\\to\\) \\(^{22}_{88}Ra\\)\u00a0 + \\(^{4}_{2}He\\) + Energy;\n\\(^{224}_{88}Ra\\)\u00a0 \\(\\to\\) \\(^{220}_{86}Rn\\)\u00a0 + \\(^{4}_{2}He\\) + Energy;\n\\(^{212}_{84}Po\\)\u00a0 \\(\\to\\) \\(^{208}_{82}Pb\\)\u00a0 + \\(^{4}_{2}He\\) + Energy;\n\\(^{216}_{84}Po\\)\u00a0 \\(\\to\\) \\(^{212}_{82}Pb\\)\u00a0 + \\(^{4}_{2}He\\) + Energy;\n\\(^{212}_{84}Rn\\)\u00a0 \\(\\to\\) \\(^{208}_{82}Po\\)\u00a0 + \\(^{4}_{2}He\\) + Energy;\n\\(^{220}_{84}Rn\\)\u00a0 \\(\\to\\) \\(^{216}_{84}Po\\)\u00a0 + \\(^{4}_{2}He\\) + Energy;\n\\(^{216}_{84}Rn\\)\u00a0 \\(\\to\\) \\(^{212}_{82}Pb\\)\u00a0 + \\(^{4}_{2}He\\) + Energy;\n(\\(\\beta\\)) Beta decay\n\\(^{224}_{88}Ra\\)\u00a0 \\(\\to\\) \\(^{224}_{89}Ac\\)\u00a0 + \\(^{o}_{-1}e\\) + Energy;\n\\(^{228}_{88}Ac\\)\u00a0 \\(\\to\\) \\(^{228}_{90}Ac\\)\u00a0 + \\(^{o}_{-1}e\\) + Energy;\n\\(^{212}_{82}Pb\\)\u00a0 \\(\\to\\) \\(^{212}_{83}Bi\\)\u00a0 + \\(^{o}_{-1}e\\) + Energy;\n\\(^{212}_{83}Ra\\)\u00a0 \\(\\to\\) \\(^{212}_{84}Ac\\)\u00a0 + \\(^{o}_{-1}e\\) + Energy;",
