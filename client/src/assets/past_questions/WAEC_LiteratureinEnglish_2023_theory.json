    "correct_answer": "Adah's first day at the Methodist school is a significant event in the plot development of 'Second Class Citizen'. It marks the beginning of Adah's journey towards self-discovery and independence. The school serves as a platform for Adah to escape from her oppressive home environment and to explore her intellectual capabilities. Her experiences at the school, including her interactions with her teachers and peers, shape her character and influence her future decisions. The school also exposes Adah to the harsh realities of gender and class discrimination, which further fuels her determination to overcome societal barriers. Therefore, Adah's first day at the Methodist school contributes significantly to the development of the plot.",

    "correct_answer": "In 'Second Class Citizen', Mr. Noble finds it difficult to evict his tenants due to several reasons. Firstly, he is bound by the legal and contractual obligations that protect the rights of the tenants. Evicting them without a valid reason could lead to legal consequences.

Despite his personal discomfort with the tenants, he recognizes their right to shelter and is reluctant to render them homeless.

    "correct_answer": "The poem\u201cA Government Driver on His Retirement\u201dby Chibuike Onu explores the emotional journey of a government driver as he retires after many years of service. The mood shifts noticeably throughout the poem to reflect\u00a0the evolving feelings of the protagonist from hope and joy to tragedy and regret.\nAt the beginning of the poem, the mood isjoyous and celebratory. The driver has completed\u201cmany years on wheels in faithful service to his fatherland\u201dand now looks forward to retirement. The tone is hopeful, reflected in the lines:\n\u201cToday retires he home / And a celebration he holds\u201d\u201cCome friends, rejoice with me / I shall booze and zoom myself home\u201d\u201cA brand new car in his name / An appreciative symbol\u201d\nThese lines reveal a mood of happiness and anticipation. The driver is excited, proud, and eager to enjoy his newfound freedom after\u201cthirty-five years of faithful services\u201d. The festive atmosphere is heightened by repeated calls to\u201crejoice\u201dand\u201cjoy till no more joy to joy\u201d.\nClosely linked to the celebratory mood is one ofrelief and liberation. The driver feels free from the\u201cduty rules and regulations\u201dthat governed his life for decades:\n\u201cToday, he\u2019ll go home a freeman\u201d\u201cToday frees and makes me a king / My patience rewarded.\u201d\nThe mood here conveys a deep sense of release from hardship and obedience. The retirement promises rest and the enjoyment of personal freedom, which brings satisfaction and pride.\nAs the poem progresses, the mood subtly shifts to one ofexcess and carelessness. The driver chooses to celebrate his freedom by\u201cboozing\u201dheavily. This excessive drinking reflects a mood of reckless abandon and loss of control:\n\u201cAnd so, he boozed and boozed / Celebrating the celebration of his retirement\u201d\u201cHe battled with his bottle booze / On his way home on wheels\u201d\nThe mood here is less joyful and more indulgent. It hints\u00a0at an impending problem.\nThe poem then introduces a mood ofdanger and foreboding. The driver\u2019s heavy drinking affects his\u201cvision and clear judgment\u201d, leading to a tragic accident:\n\u201cBooze boozed his vision and clear judgment / He boomed his brand new car\u201d\nThis mood is tense and ominous. The earlier joyful celebration is overshadowed by the careless consequences of excess. The poem signals that the driver\u2019s actions may have serious repercussions.\nThe closing lines bring a mood oftragedy and finality. The phrase\u201cIt sent him home / Home to rest in peace\u201dimplies that the accident was fatal. The mood is somber and mournful. It contrasts\u00a0sharply with the earlier joyous mood:\nThe celebration that began with promise ends in death, highlighting the tragic irony of the driver\u2019s retirement.\nIn summary, the poem\u2019s mood evolves through five distinct phases: joy and celebration, relief and liberation, excess and carelessness, danger and foreboding, and tragedy and finality.\u00a0 This progression of mood effectively tells a cautionary tale about the dangers of excess and the unpredictability of life, especially in moments meant for joy and freedom.",

    "correct_answer": "Dylan Thomas\u2019s poem\u201cDo Not Go Gentle into That Good Night\u201dis a powerful villanelle that employs carefully selected diction to express a passionate plea against passive death. The poet\u2019s choice of words is intense, emotive\u00a0and symbolic. This contributes\u00a0to the poem\u2019s urgent tone and universal theme of resistance in the face of mortality. His diction is both elevated and evocative.\nFirstly, Thomas usesimperative languageto convey urgency and command. Phrases such as\u201cDo not go gentle\u201dand\u201cRage, rage against the dying of the light\u201dare direct appeals, not just gentle suggestions. The repetition of these lines throughout the poem reflects the speaker's desperate insistence that the dying should fight against death rather than accept it passively.\nSecondly, the poet employssymbolic dictionto represent life and death. For instance,\u201cthat good night\u201dsymbolises death, a euphemistic yet poetic expression that softens the harshness of the subject while still acknowledging its finality. Similarly,\u201cthe dying of the light\u201dsymbolises the end of life. These metaphors make the abstract concepts of death and dying more vivid and relatable.\nThirdly, Thomas\u2019s diction includescontrasting adjectives and adverbsthat highlight the tension between acceptance and resistance. The word\u201cgentle\u201d, typically associated with peace and calm, is contrasted with\u201crage\u201d, a word brimming with violent emotion. This contrast underscores the central conflict of the poem \u2014 whether to yield to death or resist it with fervour.\nIn addition, the poet makes use ofevocative and descriptive languageto characterise different types of men and their responses to death. For example,\u201cwise men\u201d, \u201cgood men\u201d, \u201cwild men\u201d, and \u201cgrave men\u201dare all described with verbs and adjectives that reflect their life choices and regrets. This descriptive diction gives each character depth and shows that, regardless of their paths in life, they all resist death in the end.\nLastly, Thomas\u2019s diction reflects asonorous, lyrical qualitythat enhances the poem\u2019s emotional resonance. Words such as\u201cblinding sight\u201d,\u201cfierce tears\u201d, and\u201cfrail deeds\u201dcarry a musical rhythm and intensity that make the poem memorable. The careful selection of such emotionally charged words creates an atmosphere of defiance, sorrow, and admiration.\nIn conclusion, Dylan Thomas\u2019s diction in\u201cDo Not Go Gentle into That Good Night\u201dis deliberate and powerful. Through imperative commands, symbolic metaphors, emotive contrasts, vivid characterisation\u00a0and lyrical language, the poet underscores the poem\u2019s message: that life is precious and worth fighting for, even in the face of inevitable death.",
