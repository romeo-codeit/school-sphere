It ensures that laws are applied equally and fairly, without favouritism.\nWhile these tribunals are established to handle specific types of disputes (e.g., labour, tax), they sometimes operate outside the regular judicial system, which can lead to inconsistencies in how laws are applied. If these tribunals are not bound by the same legal standards as regular courts, it can undermine the rule of law.\nAlso, when certain individuals (e.g., government officials, diplomats) are granted special legal immunities, it means they are not held accountable under the same laws as ordinary citizens. This can lead to an abuse of power and a violation of the rule of law, as it creates a system where some people are above the law.",
