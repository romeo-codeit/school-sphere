    "explanation": "In literature, a 'symbol' is an object, person, or situation that has another meaning other than its literal meaning.

    "explanation": "Allegory is a narration or description in which events, actions, characters, settings or objects represent specific abstractions or ideas. Allegory generally operates on two levels as a literary device. The overt or surface narrative/description is meant to have enough literary elements to be a standalone work that is interesting and/or entertaining by itself. However, the emphasis of allegory is typically placed on the abstract ideals represented or symbolized by the work's literary elements. In other words, the meaning behind the surface narrative has even greater value as a literary work. Though many allegories are intended to be didactic in providing a moral, ethical, or religious lesson, not all allegories set out to achieve this goal.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

When Lakunle doesn't agree with this, she asks him if he wants the village to think she wasn't a virgin and had\u00a0to shamefully marry him without a price. By emphasizing the importance of the bride price and ensuring that it is paid before marriage, Sidi is asserting her purity and honour.
