These computers are usually designed to serve multiple users simultaneously. They rae more expensive than microcomputer.\n(3) Mainframe Computer; These are computers with large storage capacities and very high speed processing. They support a large number of terminals for simultaneous use by a number of users like ATM transactions\n(4) Super computer; These are computer with extremely large storage capacities and computing speed which are many times faster than other computers.\n(b) Define Information and Communication Technology (ICT);ICT is a means of using computer with other gadgets in collecting an giving information. OR It is a world of encompassing/combining computer together with other communication devices to generate, process and transmit information. ICT is a diverse means of collecting, processing, storing and transmitting information using modem equipment/gadget/devices. ICT can also be referred to all the technologies used to handle telecommunication\u00a0and information transmission systems.\n(c) Highlight three ways ICT has impacted on the society;(i) It enhances communication speed (ii) It lowers communication cost (iii) It is a reliable mode of communication (iv) It is an effective means of sharing information (v) It makes our society/environment paperless (vi) It creates border less communication (vii) Health problem (viii) Social problem (cyber crime, hackers threat) (ix) It improves quality of instruction (x) Enhances entertainment and sports (xi) It improves security and control (xii) It helps in the military (xiii) It enhances physical and mental stress (xiv) It reduces unemployment (xv) It causes back pain (xvi) It improves service delivery",
