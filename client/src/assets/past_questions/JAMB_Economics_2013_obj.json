Inflation occurs when there is excess money in circulation.\u00a0This means that, much money will be used to purchase few goods.\nThe central bank uses discount rates to control inflation by taking out the excess money in circulation. They do this by increasing interest rates to encourage people to save or\u00a0invest and discourage borrowings. By saving and investment, the excess money in the economy is taken out.

In this context it\u00a0is the removal of regulations and restrictions such as subsidy paid by the Nigerian government on petroleum products.\nOne of the main reasons\u00a0for deregulating the petroleum sector is to make the sector competitive, efficient and with lower product prices. The government has been paying for subsidy and this has led to stealing and corruption in that sector as well as high cost of refined products. If the sector is deregulated, petroleum products would be refined and sold in Nigeria eliminating\u00a0the extra cost of paying for subsidy by re-importing the refined products.",
