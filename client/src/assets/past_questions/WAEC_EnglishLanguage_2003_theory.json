    "correct_answer": "26 Olubayo StreetOgba, lkejaLagos.15th May, 2003.\nDear Oladele,I was delighted to learn that you've gained an admission into Prospect High School, a boarding secondary school. I am therefore writing to tell you about some problems you are likely to face as you go into secondary school. I will also tell you the possible ways of solving these problems so that you will not experience a hard time at school.The first problem you may have to face is coping with the challenges ofbeing a student in a totally new environment socially and educationally. As secondary school is quite different from primary school, you are likely to face new challenges. This level ofeducation is more tasking and challenging than primary school education.This means thatyou will have to sit tight to meet the demands of this great step in your life.You must always do your school works on time and treat them with all the seriousness they deserve. This will put you in a good stead with your teachers. Try to do all your assignments very well, because they are added up at the end of the term, as your continuous assessment marks. You must try to be the best, this you can achieve by diligent study.Secondly, you are likely to experience bullying from the older students.Take heart, as this is an inevitable aspect of what you should expect as a newcomer.This is one ofthe worst things a young child ofyour age could face. Bullying is when seniors deprive juniors ofwhat is rightfully theirs, punish juniors unnecessarily and simply maltreat them.You may not offend a senior but because he wants to show that he is a senior, he may just decide to treat you badly. I know it is very painful, because it happened to me when I was in your shoes. On the day in question, I went to fetch water from a stream.As I was getting to the entrance ofthe hostel, a senior just accosted me telling me to carry the bucket of water to his room. This made me cry bitterly but there was nothing I could do.Thirdly, you may likely face the problem of getting new friends. It would be impossible to enjoy your secondary school life without friends. As you know, I had lots of friends while in school and I really enjoyed it. What you just have to make sure you do is that you must choose good and hardworking friends. Your friends must be friends with good qualities.An adage thus goes: \"show me your friends and I will tell you who you are? As a good child, if you keep bad friends, you will soon be like them. This will therefore make you a disgrace to our family and I am sure you don't want to be that.In order to solve these problems, look for a teacher who you like best and make him your foster father. He will monitor your activities in the school. You should also look for a senior most probably in senior secondary school three. You will have someone to run to if you are bullied.You must also be nice to your mates, seniors, teachers and in general be a very good child so th.at you can make our parents proud.How are you? I hope that you are getting ready for the new challenges. My regards to Toni Shala Jide Mummy and Daddy. I hope that Aunty Seun and her children are fine.Yours sincerely,Boluwaji.",

This dangerous state of our environment is quite appalling and disturbing. The environmental condition is growing worse everyday at an alarming rate One of the health hazards the people of this Local Government facing is the unhealthy state of the environment. The environment which includes our roads, drainage system and pollution and so on are now becoming eye sores According to medical practitioners, an unhealthy environment such as ours brings about diseases such as typhoid fever. malaria, cholera etc. just to mention but a few. For example, our drainages are water-clogged and so they have become breeding ground for mosquitoes Mosquitoes are agents of malaria fever and they spread this disease through mosquito bites. In fact, most of our heath centres and clinics have dirty drainages right in front of them. How do we explain this? Our drainage facilities are not the only eyesores around us but also our roads. Most bus-stops are now reduced to dumping sites where refused dumps and dirts are disposed of which makes our environment unsightly.Also, there is this problem of air pollution. We all need air to survive. We breathe in air and breath air out but what becomes our fate when the air we breathe in and out everyday is polluted. The polluted air comes from exhaust pipe of motor vehicles especially vans and lorries, from factories, from dumping sites. Many people suffer from this hazard. Such polluted air may even cause cancer of the lungs and all other related diseases.Moreover, the people of the local government are also faced with the problem of noise. There is noise everywhere on the streets, at motor parks, bus-stops etc. Noise has dominated every street and it is so much that one can hardly hear oneself speak. At every street, shops selling musical cassettes bring out four or more loud-speakers to blare out music. If this habit is not eradicated, over forty-five percent of our people would suffer from partial deafness.However, I believe that whatever has a problem has a solution. Therefore, I would like to suggest the following solution problems mentioned above. Firstly, there should be health managers who will be going about cleaning the drainages. Those who throw rubbish into our drainages or on the roads should be punished by paying fines or even by imprisonment so as to serve as deterrent to others.Moreso, motorists should be advised to take their vehicles for servicing regularly so as to reduce air pollution\u00a0through vehicle exhaust pipes. Industries located within the local government area should also be inspected and corrected in this respect so as to keep our environment healthy.In conclusion, I believe that if my points are well considered, we would make our environment a better place to live in.\nYours faithfully,SignatureOlukunle Ibikunle.",

They include teachers, civil servants and the much talked about policemen and women.It is obvious that our public offices are stinking with corruption. Public officers who had. been known in the past as exemplary examples of good conduct are now corrupt. Our public offices are occupied by dishonest and corrupt people. Nowadays, you can now talk about corrupt teachers, doctors, nurses, government officials and policemen and women.This ugly development has a far-reaching implication for our society. It has made us lose our great values and qualities such as honesty, hard work and good conduct. All these values are now replaced with bribery, corruption, immorality and mediocrity. It is high time we nipped this development in the bud with a drastic measure like capital punishment.Ladies and gentlemen, should we continue to promote corruption in our society? Definitely no. We should all rise up to combat corruption among our public officers. If we could execute armed robbers by firing squad, why shouldn't we do the same thing to any corrupt officer who is found guilty of using his office to enrich himself unjustly at the expense of the people. I am sure my opponent would want us to understand that capital punishment is outdated and out fashioned forgetting that a corrupt officer is worse than an armed robber because such corrupt officer is dangerous to the societal values that we cherish so much.Capital punishment for corrupt public officers is the only measure that can bring sanity to our public offices. If public officers realise that capital punishment will be meted out to them if they are found guilty. they will conduct themselves in the rightful manner expected of their offices. We have all been talking about corruption among our public officers. The only step we can take in eradicating corruption is by taking drastic measures such as capital punishment. Enough of slogans against corruption among public officers. Slogans. you will all agree with me. can not eradicate corruption; it can only encourage it. On the other hand, if guilty corrupt officers are punished with execution by firing squad or amputation of their arms, we would achieve positive results.Furthermore, our past glories in public services can be brought back if we punish public officers with capital punishment. It will make public service itself worthwhile and this will lead to having a decent society. It will discourage all forms of sleaze in our society and redeem the battered image of the country abroad. It will further promote the love of Nigerians for their country.In conclusion, I think that our corrupt public officers too deserve capital punishment. The argument that capital punishment will offend our decency as a nation is out of place. A corrupt public officer has done more harm to the society than a robber.

Ofuchi was a palm-wine tapper and he lived with his family and step brother in homesteads built on the land they inherited from their father. The name of Ofuchi's step brother was Ndubuisi. Ndubuisi was a farmer and he had a son called Nnaji after his own father. Ofuchi had three children who were all male.These two brothers built their huts on the two extremes of the land handed over to them by their father. When their father was about to die, he called Ofuchi and took the right hand of his brother, Ndubuisi, handed it over to Ofuchi meaning Ofuchi should assume responsiblity over his step brother. This was the last assignment the old man performed on earth. He said: \"If your brother has offended you, forgive him. In him, you have a partner and somebody to rely on a bunch of broom is always very difficult to break. Be in unity and plan no evil against one another\". Soon after uttering these words, he surrendered to the cold hands of death.The final words of the old man guided Ofuchi and Ndubusi's behaviour towards one another for a number of years. They prefered to live closer to one another, building their huts on the same piece of land their father left behind for them. They both got married. The name of Ofuchi's wife was Nne while the name of Ndubuisi's was Ifeoma.Nnaji, Ndubuisi's only child was growing up in the same compound with the three male children of Ofuchi. When he was old enough to start schooling, he was registered in the school that his other brothers were attending. However, Nnaji was very brilliant at school. He was more brilliant than the three children of Ofuchi. He came out top in every examination in the school and so he was loved by his teachers. He was so brilliant that he was given double promotion and soon after enrolling in school, he was in the same class with the second child of Ofuchi.There was a time that Nnaji's teachers in school followed him home to encourage his father to endeavour to send him to the only secondary school which was about five kilometers from their village after the completion of his primary education.The recognition of Nnaji's brilliance began to create animosity and envy at home. Ofuchi decided to give a gap between his wife and those of his brothers. It was at this period that Ofuchi remembered what he was told concerning\u00a0his mother's death. He was told that his step brother's mother was responsible for the mysterious death of his step-mother. He therefore decided to take revenge on Ndubuisi by killing his only male child, Nnaji.He thought out a plan to poison Nnaji since his children and Naji ate together as a family. He went to the house of \u00a0the medicine man to collect poison. On the day he had planned to execute his diabolical plan, his wife had prepared the food of the children before going to the market. Unknown to her, Ofuchi went to put poison in the food he thought Nnaji \u00a0would eat since he was always the first to arrive from school. On this day, Nnaji was a little bit delayed at school. and \u00a0Ofuchi 's first child, Ike was the first to arrive home hungry. He picked the food and hungrily ate it. Soon after Ofuchi and \u00a0his wife arrived and met Ike holding his stomach crying out for help.

Standing about 2.5 metres tall and weighing up to 155 kilograms, the ostrich is the largest bird in existence. No one can fail to be awed and fascinated by the bird's great height, powerful legs and beautiful fluffy feathers.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Like the camel, the ostrich is tolerant of high temperatures and thrives in desert country. It also has long luxuriant eyelashes which protect its large eyes from the dust of the bushveld. Its legs are long and sinewy and its feet are strong creeps or crawls. It also dines on insects, snakes, rodents, roots and most vegetation. Because of its great size it cannot fly. However, its muscular legs are powerful enough to make it one of the fastest creatures on earth. Running across desert country, it can attain speeds of up to 65 kilometres an hour!

He was the only man to testify against his own people in that dispute, and had struck the District Officer as an honest man who was telling the truth.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This was what earned Ibezim the admiration and friendship of the District Officer. Consequently, the District Officer advised him to send his son to the new school and the new religion that held out so much promise of positive change in the future. And when the system of indirect rule necessitated the appointment of a warrant chief at Ndiuzo, the District Officer also promptly thought of his honest friend as the most suitable candidate.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 On the other hand, lbesim s testimony in the land dispute earned him the wrath of many of his own people. They not only held him responsible for their loss of the disputed land but also resented his friendship with the District Officer and his patronage of the new education and religion which were threatening to erode the old ways of the land. So, when the District Officer wanted Chief lbezim at Umueke. and he sought to confer with his people on what to do, his detractors quickly turned their backs on him and left him alone in his dilemma.

This lengthening of life has been one of the greatest achievements of humanity. It was in recognition of this fact that the United Nations formally designated 1999 as the \"International Year of Older Persons\". Demographers tell a surprising story: octogenarians and older people, instead of the young, now form the fastest growing population group on earth.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 What then are the factors that determine man's health and the length of his life? Recent studies have identified so\u201e of these. It is known that the sounder your habits the longer your life may last. Nutritionists have told us that we W what we eat, that is to say, that what we eat influences the state of our health. Instead of over-eating, one should e,e a balanced diet including fruit and plenty of vegetables. Moderate physical exercise on a regular basis is of immense benefit. The family doctor should be consulted on how much exercise and what type are most appropriate for each individual. studies have shown that simple exercises in and around the home help the elderly to regain strength and vitality.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The adage \"use it or lose it\" applies not only to the muscles but also to the mind. Mental exercise keeps the brains \"telephone lines\" alive whereas mental decline or serenity starts the moment a person retires and decides to take things easy in the erroneous belief that doesn't have to keep up with the world any more. Many retired civil servants fall into this bad habit. They can change this unhealthy habit by being actively engaged in reading, travel, education, clubs, professional associations. It is believed that such activities not only lift the spirit but also \"rewire\"the brain.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In addition to these is the environment. In many developing countries the environment poses grave dangers to health, often resulting in preventable deaths. \u00a0Access to clean safe water is severely limited. There are huge mountains of refuse breeding vermin, cockroaches and disease causing germs in both rural and urban areas. All this contribute, to the low life expectancy in these countries. Better sanitation, safer water for all and a reduction of vermin in the home will improve man's environment bolster his health and extend his life-span.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The next factor is the state of medical care available in our countries. In the developed countries, advances in medical science have dramatically improved health and delivery. Unfortunately, the reverse has been the case in the poor countries of Africa and Asia. For example, in the USA, only one woman in 12,500 dies from pregnancy-related causes whereas one in 21 dies in Africa from the same causes! That speaks volumes about the deplorable state medical services.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Finally, man has made a breakthrough in controlling his genetic make-up. A decade or so ago, he had no control whatsoever over his genetic engineering. Now, he can re-design his genetic constitution to ensure better health and longer life.\n(a) In six sentences, one for each, state the factors that improve man's health and life-span.",
