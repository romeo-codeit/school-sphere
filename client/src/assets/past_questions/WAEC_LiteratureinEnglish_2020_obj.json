The lines \"I find no peace and all my war is done\" convey a lack of tranquillity or calmness, suggesting that the narrator is not at peace. The use of \"war is done\" may imply that external conflicts or struggles have concluded, but there is still an internal turmoil.\nThe following lines intensify the theme of contradiction: \"I fear and hope. I burn and freeze like ice.\" Here, the narrator mentions fearing and hoping simultaneously, which are opposing emotions. The imagery of burning and freezing adds to the sense of contradiction, as these sensations represent extreme opposites in terms of temperature and emotional states.\nThe overall mood created by these lines is one of inner turmoil, indecision, and conflicting emotions, pointing towards a state of confusion (option A). The narrator seems to be grappling with contradictory feelings, making it difficult for them to find a clear or settled emotional state.",
