    "correct_answer": "This study was undertaken to establish the reasons why students in higher educational institutions in Delta State of Nigeria join secret cults on the campuses, the effects of the incidence, and the strategies to employ to eradicate it from the institutions. It was a descriptive survey in design, and using a systematic, proportionate random sample of 665 students, 220 lecturers and 115 school administrators in the state-owned University, three Colleges of Education and three Polytechnics, who duly completed a closed-ended and open-ended 31-item questionnaire, the study confirmed the supposition that students join secret cults in the institutions to terrorize lecturers to pass their courses at all cost, and to provide security services to new initiates and shield them from oppressive students and the perceived hostility of wicked lecturers. A number of effects of the secret cults in the institutions were also established, some of these being cultism leading to certificates not being backed up with true academic struggle, and this leading to reduction in manpower quality; by design, cultists seriously abusing hard drugs like cocaine and alcohol, and in that state of mind, committing heinous crimes; identified and expelled cultists possibly becoming school drop-outs, robbers, prostitutes, drug-peddlers and maladjusted people in life; and cultists spearheading riots at the slightest opportunity and in the process looting and causing damage to school property.

Some of the narcotics and psychotropic drugs include : cannabis, cocaine, heroine, codeine, tramadol and so on. Those who abuse these drugs depend on them and cannot function optimally except they take them.Drug\u00a0abuse can be caused by a number of mental illnesses such as depression and bipolar\u00a0disorders. These disorders may cause people to resort to drugs to manage the symptoms.\u00a0When these drugs are used, there is a momentary escape from their problems until a relapse occurs.Peer influence is also one of the leading causes of drug abuse among youths. When a young person sees his or her peers taking something and then feeling better afterwards,\u00a0such youth will likely engage in such. It is easier for youths to be influenced by\u00a0friends because they want to experiment and impress until it becomes an addiction they are unable to break free from.Another cause of drug abuse is unstable family background. A young person who lacks family attention are more likely to abuse drugs. When there is no parent-child relationship, substance abuse is most likely inevitable and such children usually find solace in drug misuse. Also, children whose parents abuse drugs are likely to follow suit as they won't see it as\u00a0wrong.In order for drug abuse to be curbed to its barest minimum,\u00a0youths have to be educated on the negative ettects of\u00a0abusing drugs especially for those who haven't engaged in it already.

I am writing to give an account of the recent school fight and also to prove Damola Oyebade's innocence to the school authorities.It all started out as an argument in our class Senior Secondary School three Emerald. A boy named Bassey Ntoyo had eariier been flogged by Mr. Bright, the Biology teacher for failing his test. An argument ensued in class about Mr. Bright's partiality in awarding marks in his tests. Bassey accused Damola of not deserving the mark he got, this made Damola respond angrily to the\u00a0accusation. They began to insult each other and Bassey slapped Damola first while the latter retaliated. It soon became a free for all fight when their friends waded in.When l discovered that the situation\u00a0was becoming uncontrollable. I alerted our class teacher Miss Dumebi. She tried to put an end to the fight but they did not pay attention to her. She immediately left the class to get the Vice-principal to intervene but before she got back, Bassey had stabbed one of Damola's friends Ogojesu. The fight came to an abrupt end when Ogojesu started bleeding. He was rushed to the school clinic and was latter taken to the hospital in the town.The Vice Principal and Miss Dumebi alerted the school management. Damola and Bassey were both expelled without proper hearing. Sir, I am pleading on behalf of Damola because everyone knows him to be highly intelligent and respectful. These character traits earned him the position of the school's Chaplain Prefect. He was wrongly accused by Bassey and only retaliated by slapping Bassey back. Bassey is a known bully and has never been serious with his academics. He has once been suspended and now expelled for possession of weapons.I hope that this report would be enough proof of Damola's innocence in the fight. He has never been found in such situation and was only provoked by Bassey. I hope that with this, Damola would be recalled and reinstated as the school's Chaplain Prefect.

I had always been at the top right from my primary school\u00a0days till secondary school.\u00a0It all\u00a0began when I gained admission into Maybelline University, Accra.My first year in the university was smooth and I succeeded in warding off every distraction. In my second year, i\u00a0moved into a different hostel and there, I met three girls who were a year ahead of me. The girls were Ayo, Mabel and sharon. I noticed that these girls were very close and they all had something in common which was unseriousness. They hardly attend lectures and barely sleep in the hostel. I made sure that i didn't get too close to them or ask silly questions. To get me interested, they were always talking about how rich they are. They flaunted new bags, shoes and assessories.One fateful day, my curiousity got the better of me and I decided to follow them to Sharon's birthday party. She said her boyfriend wanted to celebrate it for her and that we will be back before night fall. Kunle her boyfriend was already waiting outside in his car. We got to the hotel after about an hour. I was introduced to a young man called Daniel. We exchanged contacts and things kicked off pretty soon between the two of us. I went to clubs several times With Daniel, after that day.After some months, I became pregnant and I felt that Daniel would be happy about it since he promised to marry me. I visited him in his house to inform him the same day I got tested only to meet the greatest surprise of my life. I met a young lady in his house who introduced herself as Daniel's fiancee. I was shocked beyond words when I heard that. To worsen the situation, Daniel came out soon after to confirm her words. He denied knowing me when she asked him who I was. At that moment, i\u00a0felt like vanishing into thin air. I couldn't even tell him what I wanted to; I opened my mouth but words wouldn't come out. I turned and went back to my hostel in shame. I took a few of my clothes and went home for the semester break.At home, I kept vomitting and was taken to the hospital where I was confirmed pregnant. My parents were disappointed as\u00a0i didn't even have anyone to present as the father of my child. I remembered all the Christian upbringing I had as a child. Alas!

They flaunted new bags, shoes and assessories.One fateful day, my curiousity got the better of me and I decided to follow them to Sharon's birthday party. She said her boyfriend wanted to celebrate it for her and that we will be back before night fall. Kunle her boyfriend was already waiting outside in his car. We got to the hotel after about an hour. I was introduced to a young man called Daniel. We exchanged contacts and things kicked off pretty soon between the two of us. I went to clubs several times With Daniel, after that day.After some months, I became pregnant and I felt that Daniel would be happy about it since he promised to marry me. I visited him in his house to inform him the same day I got tested only to meet the greatest surprise of my life. I met a young lady in his house who introduced herself as Daniel's fiancee. I was shocked beyond words when I heard that. To worsen the situation, Daniel came out soon after to confirm her words. He denied knowing me when she asked him who I was. At that moment, i\u00a0felt like vanishing into thin air. I couldn't even tell him what I wanted to; I opened my mouth but words wouldn't come out. I turned and went back to my hostel in shame. I took a few of my clothes and went home for the semester break.At home, I kept vomitting and was taken to the hospital where I was confirmed pregnant. My parents were disappointed as\u00a0i didn't even have anyone to present as the father of my child. I remembered all the Christian upbringing I had as a child. Alas! I thought to myself, how I wish I had listened to my parents.",
