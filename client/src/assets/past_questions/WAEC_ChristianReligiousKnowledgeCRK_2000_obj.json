    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "According to the prophet Amos in the Old Testament of the Bible, true religion consists of righteousness and justice rather than mere external religious activities. The specific reference is found in the Book of Amos, particularly in Amos 5:21-24 (RSV):\n\"21 I hate, I despise your feasts, and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies. 22 Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and cereal offerings, I will not accept them, and the peace offerings of your fatted beasts I will not look upon. 23 Take away from me the noise of your songs; to the melody of your harps I will not listen. 24 But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.\"\nIn these verses, Amos criticizes the people for engaging in religious rituals and festivals without genuinely pursuing justice and righteousness. He emphasizes that God desires a heart of justice and righteousness more than outward religious observances. Therefore, option D, \"purity of heart and righteousness,\" is the answer.",
