    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Addition reaction\nEthyne (also known as acetylene) is an alkyne, a type of unsaturated hydrocarbon. Alkynes are characterized by their triple bond, which makes them highly reactive.\nEthyne mainly undergoes addition reactions, where molecules add to the triple bond. Examples of addition reactions involving ethyne include:\n- Hydrogenation (addition of hydrogen)\n- Halogenation (addition of halogens, such as chlorine or bromine)\n- Hydration (addition of water)\nThe other options are not correct:\nB. Carboxylation is a reaction that involves the addition of a carboxyl group (-COOH), which is not a typical reaction for ethyne.\nC. Esterification is a reaction between an acid and an alcohol to form an ester, which is not relevant to ethyne.\nD. Substitution reactions involve replacing one atom or group with another, which is not the primary type of reaction undergone by ethyne.",
