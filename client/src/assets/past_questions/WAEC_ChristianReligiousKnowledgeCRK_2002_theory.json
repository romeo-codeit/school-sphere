He spoke of imminence of the great occasion and the need for Christians to lead a good life in readiness for Jesus at his second coming. Some Thessalonian Christians were led to the misconception that the Parousia was just around the corner. They felt there was, therefore, no need for them to exert themselves in further physical work, what mattered was to watch and\u00a0pray. When Paul received the news that some Thessalonians had folded their hands and refused to work and that they\u00a0had even constituted themselves into a nuisance for the others, by either preventing them from their work or by solely depending on them for their bread, he had to write to them in very strong terms in order to disabuse the minds of such lazy people. Paul said categorically that whoever refuses to work should not eat.\nPeople should honestly help\u00a0themselves to work, without eye-service, as if they were serving the Lord. He reminded them that when he was with them he was not parasitic, although he had the right to depend on them for his physical needs. He had worked with his own hands in order to maintain himself and be, for them, an exam worthy of emulation. It was therefore compulsory for the lazy to get down to work with their hands. But should they not heed his advice they should be boycotted to their shame. However, he warned that they should not be treated as enemies, but warned and re-directed with brotherly love, to retrace their steps and do the right thing.",

He spoke of imminence of the great occasion and the need for Christians to lead a good life in readiness for Jesus at his second coming. Some Thessalonian Christians were led to the misconception that the Parousia was just around the corner. They felt there was, therefore, no need for them to exert themselves in further physical work, what mattered was to watch and\u00a0pray. When Paul received the news that some Thessalonians had folded their hands and refused to work and that they\u00a0had even constituted themselves into a nuisance for the others, by either preventing them from their work or by solely depending on them for their bread, he had to write to them in very strong terms in order to disabuse the minds of such lazy people. Paul said categorically that whoever refuses to work should not eat.\nPeople should honestly help\u00a0themselves to work, without eye-service, as if they were serving the Lord. He reminded them that when he was with them he was not parasitic, although he had the right to depend on them for his physical needs. He had worked with his own hands in order to maintain himself and be, for them, an exam worthy of emulation. It was therefore compulsory for the lazy to get down to work with their hands. But should they not heed his advice they should be boycotted to their shame. However, he warned that they should not be treated as enemies, but warned and re-directed with brotherly love, to retrace their steps and do the right thing.",

This included the fact that Jesus died for the sins of the world, he was buried and was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures. He appeared to Cephas and the twelve and later to more than five hundred brethren at one time, some of which were still alive while some had fallen asleep. Then, he appeared to James and all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to Paul who being the least of the apostles was unfit to be called an apostle because he had persecuted the church of God.\n(ii) The grace of God towards Paul made him what he was for Christ and such grace was not in vain. It made Paul to work harder than any of those who received Christ before him.\n(iii) If there was no resurrection, it meant that Christ had not been raised and the apostolic preaching and the Christian faith should have been in vain for the apostles must have been misrepresenting God who they preached had raised Christ from the dead.\n(iv) If Christ had not been raised, then their faith was futile.
