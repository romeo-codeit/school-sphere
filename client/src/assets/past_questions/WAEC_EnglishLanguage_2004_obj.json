    "explanation": "\u201cNearly\u201d fits well with \u201cweren\u2019t\u201d to express that the bananas werenot quite ripe enough, which matches the intended meaning. So the completed sentence is:\"The bananas weren\u2019t nearly ripe enough to use today.\"\n\u201cAlmost\u201d is typically used in affirmative statements (e.g.,The bananas are almost ripe), but in negative statements, it can sound awkward or ambiguous. \u201cScarcely\u201d means \u201cbarely\u201d or \u201conly just,\u201d and is usually used in a slightly different context. It also sounds awkward with \u201cweren\u2019t\u201d (double negation).\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHardly\u201d also implies \u201cbarely,\u201d but like \u201cscarcely,\u201d when used with a negative verb like \u201cweren\u2019t,\u201d it becomes a double negative, which is grammatically incorrect in standard English.",

If you say \"I can't find neither of the two books,\" it creates a double negative, which is grammatically incorrect. \"Any\" is\u00a0used when referring to more than two items.
