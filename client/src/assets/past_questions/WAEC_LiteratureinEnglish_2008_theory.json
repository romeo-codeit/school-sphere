Sizwe's letter to his wife in King William's Town while he is in Port Elizabeth seeking a job brings out this fact. Buntun lives alone because his wife \"only comes home weekends.\" The cruel apartheid system which separates these families places them under great emotional stress.\nThere are constant police raids that, sometimes result in violence and the deportation of blacks from one township to another. Sizwe narrates one such raid when he is staying with Zola. He is ruthlessly dragged out when found hiding under a table and taken to the Labour Bureau where his passport is stamped. Sizwe has to move to Buntu's place to escape this constant police harassment. The police raids are an enforcement of the inhuman residential laws which seek to regulate the movement of blacks.\nThere is also the issue of the passbook. The passbook is the instrument used to destroy the blackman's identity, he becomes a mere figure on the computer. With the passbook, the blackman's sense of self-respect, dignity and pride is eroded and his dehumanization is complete. Buntu asks Sizwe:\n\"When whiteman looked at you at the Labour Bureau what did he see? A man with dignity or a bloody passbook with NI number?\" The truth of this dehumanization becomes all too clear when in his metamorphosis into his new identity as Robert Zwelinzima, Sizwe becomes psychologically confused and says: \"I am all mixed up. Who am I? This is the final fact of the predicament of the Blackman in South Africa.\nThe issue of the restrictive labour laws in white townships that make looking for a job a nightmare may be also considered. Buntu's story of the difficulty he has before securing a job even though he was born in Port Elizabeth is a case in point. Buntu talks of his tiring movements between King Williams town and Port Elizabeth, carrying letters back and forth to get Sizwe's passbook stamped. Even when the Blackman gets a job, he is used and dumped. The laborious life of Outa Jacob brings this fact out. Blacks are also exposed to the occupational hazard of working in the mines.

James is convinced that these professions are more lucrative than teaching, since the community is prepared to pay for the services they offer. He believes that anybody who wants to get on in life must learn that money is what matters, that money is power. James, therefore, wishes his two youngest children to study Engineering and Law respectively.\nHe even goes to the extent of asking his friend, Lawyer Bonu, to secure admissions for them abroad. Contrary to the wishes of their father, Aaron and Maanan want to study painting and dancing respectively.

    "correct_answer": "The society which Bolt presents is a morally decadent one in which the values normally associated with civilized society are destroyed. It is a cynical world in which 'every man has his price.' The king, who is the head of state, unsurps the power of the church because he now finds it convenient to do so. His lack of morals is clearly demonstrated in his desire to sacrifice correct behaviour on the altar of expediency.\nThe very dispensation which he persuades the Pope to give to allow him to marry his late brother's wife, he now tries to get the Pope to reverse, so that he can divorce his wife and marry another. When the Pope will not co-operate, he seeks through 'legal means, to strip him of all his power. Rather than serve as the fountain of honour and justice, the king perverts justice and debases honour. He is assertive and corrupt, determined to achieve his aims by any means possible. He does not find it difficult to garner support for his scheme because of the moral bankruptcy of the society. One of his most ardent supporters is Thomas Cromwell, an opportunist and an instrument of the King. He, like the King, will ignore all the niceties of conscience to achieve what he desires. The king also gets support from other officials whose primary aim is to keep themselves in comfortable positions. Richard Rich is one such character.\nHis lack of remorse after he has betrayed More points to the level to which society has degenerated. This is why More's sterling qualities radiate in the play. Social institutions also come in for scathing criticism in the play. The church is censured for allowing itself to be manipulated by the King. And the trial of More exposes the perversion of justice which has become characteristic of the judiciary. The ordinary people too, do not escape Bolt's censure. The woman who gives a \"gift\" to More in the form of a silver cup is a good example. We see therefore that corruption has become a way of life in the society and that values have been perverted.",

When the Pope will not co-operate, he seeks through 'legal means, to strip him of all his power. Rather than serve as the fountain of honour and justice, the king perverts justice and debases honour. He is assertive and corrupt, determined to achieve his aims by any means possible. He does not find it difficult to garner support for his scheme because of the moral bankruptcy of the society. One of his most ardent supporters is Thomas Cromwell, an opportunist and an instrument of the King. He, like the King, will ignore all the niceties of conscience to achieve what he desires. The king also gets support from other officials whose primary aim is to keep themselves in comfortable positions. Richard Rich is one such character.\nHis lack of remorse after he has betrayed More points to the level to which society has degenerated. This is why More's sterling qualities radiate in the play. Social institutions also come in for scathing criticism in the play. The church is censured for allowing itself to be manipulated by the King. And the trial of More exposes the perversion of justice which has become characteristic of the judiciary. The ordinary people too, do not escape Bolt's censure. The woman who gives a \"gift\" to More in the form of a silver cup is a good example. We see therefore that corruption has become a way of life in the society and that values have been perverted.",

These relationships determine the direction of the plot. Rich is a friend of More's. Very early in the play, More takes Rich's loyalty for granted and opens up considerably to Rich to his detriment. For the sake of friendship, More offers Rich valuable advice concerning a career: teaching is quiet, safe and devoid of temptation. Rich rebuffs the advice. More gives Rich a cup he has been offered as a \"gift\". Rich accepts this. However, Rich shows divided loyalty. He denies his friendship with More when Cromwell asks him about it. His switching of friendship from More to Cromwell for the sake of getting a good job and an enhanced life is under-standable. In befriending Cromwell, however, Rich betrays More. He provides damming evidence against More. At the trial, Rich's betrayal of More is complete when he turns star witness and lies on oath without compunction.\nThe Duke of Norfolk proves a steadfast friend to More. When the king is visiting after launching the Great Harry, More is nowhere to be found. This alarms his family and disturbs the Duke. Norfolk attempts to draw More to the side of what he sees as reason without success. But he supports More's candidature for the Chancellorship. However, Norfolk does not agree to clinging to his conscience as does More, so he stays on his job; and he does prosecute More only because it is his duty. Norfolk stands by his friend till the very end, careful to avoid More's steely adherence to his conscience.\nBetween Cromwell and More, there is no love lost. Cromwell bides his time for opportunities to hurt More. He holds More in spite. His insistence that the boatman take the correct fare is to give More up as one who overpays the boatman illegally. Cromwell is obviously not More's friend. He secures the most serious bits of evidence for condemning More through a friend of More's. However, he offers Rich a job for the opportunity to gain access to information and not because the two are friends. He intimidates, bullies and even cajoles Rich. He finally secures Rich's willingness to commit perjury. At the crucial moment, he contrives the evidence from alleged witnesses to incriminate More.\nIt is clear from the play that friendship is not based on a true and lasting relationship; rather. it depends very much on patronage, self interest and expediency and there-in lies the element of betrayal.",

For him, this talent (his sight) \"is death to hide/Lodeg with me useless\".\nThough my soul more bent/To serve therewith my maker.\" His fear is that he risks God's chastisement on his returning to Him without accomplishing much. Alluding to the biblical parable of the talent, the poet is worried that he may suffer the fate of the \"unprofitable\" servant who failed to utilize the talent given him by his master and was consequently condemned. However, he rationalizes that if it were God's wish that he achieved something in life, God would not have denied him :he necessary instrument with which to accomplish such a task. He asks rhetorically, \"doth God exact day labour, light denied?\" Upon further reflection, he quickly counsels patience \"to prevent that murmur.\"\nAgain, this is an allusion to the same \"unprofitable servant\" in the Bible who grumbles about the talent given to him and finds excuses to explain away his failure to trade and profit by it.

His name according to him, is one that brings credit to Urukpe. He is the next in rank to the traditional head and has made his mark in the rubber business.\nBoth his name and his business must therefore be protected because, according to him \"great names are rare and must not be wasted\" as it has attracted to him a lot of attention and great respect. This is\u00a0from the onset, Chief Toje is envious of Oshevire's success in business. Rather than improve on the output of his\u00a0products by way of transparent honesty and increasing his workers' salaries, he resolves to get rid of Oshevire, thus\u00a0crippling his business. To achieve his aim, he gets Oshevire arrested on trumped-up charges and pays Rukeme people r bear false witness against him. He is not worried by the activities of other competitors. Though he refers to Oshevire as an upstart, Toje knows that -e is more organized, pays,his workers better salaries and enjoys better government patronage than he, Toje, does. He goes further to covet Oshevire's wife in his .absence, believing that he will be able to use her to revive his swindling virility. He therefore entices her with gifts of food, clothing and other commodities to make her yield to his advances.\nOdibo on his own part is deeply rankled by the constant abuse meted out to him by Chief Toje. He is always minded of his physical disability, which is seen by Toje as a weakness and sign of incapability. As a result, Odibo\u00a0harbours a lot of resentment towards Toje and when he realizes his own feelings towards Aku, he begins to see Toje as a rival.\nHe goes all the way to having an affair with Aku, knowing the emotional and psychological effects this will have on Toje if it is discovered. He therefore does not hesitate to fight Toje almost to the point of death knowing that if he has the upper hand, he will be proving a point to himself and Toje at the same time he is not totally useless as assumed all As an extension, Okumagba, suffers from this unhealthy rivalry and feels cheated out of the action of the war.\nHe has joined the war believing he would be exposed to most of the action but he has been drafted to the menial job of having to merely watch over Aku and her son, more so as Aku is from the rebel tribe.

    "correct_answer": "Rukeme is a teacher in St. Martins Mission School, Urukpe. He is the son of Udefe Rukeme a rubber farmer whose Dlantation is next to Oshevire's. Rukeme's father Udefe stole latex from Oshevire's farm and the theft was reported to Tle Otota. To avenge his father's humiliation, he agrees to bear false witness against Oshevire. He acts as a front for Chief Toje who pays him in cash for the job. Rukeme ends up being an inconsistent witness. He mixes up details in the memorandum when cross examined. He serves as the major tool used by Toje to keep Oshevire in detention for the length of time he does.\nRukeme's witnessing against Oshevire portrays him as being very vengeful. He is a liar who wickedly agrees to arnish the reputation of an innocent man. Rukeme serves as a foil to Oshevire's character. Whereas Oshevire sees his last duty as honesty integrity and obeying the voice of conscience, Rukeme has no qualms in helping to indict a clearly innocent man. Rukeme's behaviour is an indication of the moral decadence which is the hallmark of a society such as theirs embroiled in war. It is a sad indictment on the absence of honesty and integrity. Rukeme also accentuates the atmosphere the insecurity pervading the society.\nHere a man can be locked up on spurious charges and made to face false accusations without anyone seeing anything wrong with this. The reconciliation between Oshevire and Rukeme resulting from Rukeme's apology is a vindication of Oshevire's stand in refusing to succumb to the pressures of the society.\nThe theme of betrayal in Silas Marner is revealed through some relationships. Both in Lantern Yard and Raveloe, friendship and trust are betrayed under various conditions. These instances of betrayal immensely enhance the plot. Silas Marner's experience of betrayal in Lantern Yard is lumped together as his reason for leaving the town. While there, Silas is an ardent member of the church assembly. He has absolute faith in God and trusts his friend William Dane completely. His engagement to Sarah is known to and approved by the church. Sarah and William, however, betray Silas, and in his view, God betrays Silas as well. By the nature of Silas's simple faith in God and trust in man, the effect of this betrayal is devastating. Silas is epileptic, He has an attack in church.\nThe congregation is prepared to put it down to a divine visitation. Nilliam bitterly opposes this interpretation and bitingly suggests that it is more likely to be a result of satan's hold on Silas. William steals church money and has Silas accused of it. He takes Silas's Sarah and marries her as well. -leading to William, Sarah betrays Silas by leaving the poor weaver in the lurch. When the lot cast shows that Silas is the thief, he is naturally beside himself with bitterness against this 'God of lies' who, he believed, will \"clear\" him. In despair, Silas relocates to Raveloe.\nIn Raveloe, the spotlight is on Godfrey Cass. By his concealing his secret marriage to Molly Farren, and also his fatherhood of Eppie, Godfrey betrays the love of Nancy. Godfrey betrays his own family and their status by marrying Molly. By his neglect of Molly, Godfrey betrays Molly and the Farren family. This betrayal is added to by Godfrey's not owning up as Eppie father when Silas take the child to the Red House. In succumbing to Dunstan's threats and not being open in his management of the estate, he betrays Squire Cass's trust as well.",
