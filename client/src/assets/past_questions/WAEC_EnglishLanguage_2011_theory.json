Everybody knows me for one thing that is: I don't like staying idle or lonely.

As you know that I cherish education a lot, I have included it in my schedule that even if I am helping my parents in their business, I will also register with one of the tutorial centres in my neighbourhood in order to get myself prepared for the next JAMB examination.

My primary ambition is to become a medical doctor over which I have sought the advice of my parents. I have been working tirelessly towards this which was the reason I chose the subjects I registered for in my final SSCE examinations.I have discussed everything with my parents and they have agreed that I will be in their shop while I also attend tutorial classes for my examinations I was even commended for coming up with this idea and they have pledged their full support for me when the programme commences.\nOlumide, I hope you too are planning for how you will spend your time after the examination.

    "correct_answer": "EFFECT OF DRUG ABUSE\nDrug, according to its generic meaning, refers to any chemical substance which, when taken into the body or applied externally, has a specific effect on its functioning. It also refers to any such substance, especially one which is abused, habitual or addictive, and possession of which is illegal. In other words., drug here is taken to mean an illegal that people swallow, smoke or inject to make them feel happy or excited.\nOrdinarily, drug can also refer to the various medicines prescribed by physicians to cure, suppress, or prevent certain ailments or diseases in the body. Drugs that are supposed to be the source of getting rid of illnesses or diseases have unfortunately now turned out to be a problem in society.\nThe indiscriminate use of drugs among the populace without following i doctor's prescriptions has had a lot of negative effects on the lives of the perpetrators, including physical and mental imbalances. Drugs are abused when one takes more than the recommended doses, or when used wrongly to achieve an intended result. This is common among the youths who believe that taking hard drugs whenever they want to carry out any arduous task gives them extra strength. Drugs commonly used include cocaine, heroine, Indian hemp, etc, which are mostly injurious to the body and health of perpetrators.\nDrug abuse has become a matter of constant discussion in the media all over the country in recent times. The menace of this evil is becoming so alarming that every sector of our society has been plagued by it.\nThere are lots of dangers in drug abuse. In fact, many people. out of ignorance have jeopadised their lives by taking more than recommended drugs for medication. Sometimes some of the drug users take drugs to enhance their performance at sporting activities, or to make them stay awake when preparing for examinations or other events.\nIn our society nowadays, it is common to see young children with one deformity or the other. This is often the result of pregnant mothers taking wrong or illegal drugs during pregnancy.\nDrug abuse also leads to severe psychiatric cases such as we have around in the country these days. Many youths i who abuse hard drugs always end up having mental problems which subsequently land them in psychiatric hospitals.\nOur national prestige and honour are at stake because of the negative effects of this anti-social case of i drug abuse. Many Nigerians traveling abroad are from time to time subjected to humiliating searches at the points of entry into other countries. This has really dented the image of this country. Many Nigerians have also been jailed for drug trafficking.\nMany crimes committed can be traced to drug abuse. The high rate of criminal activities is an indication of the danger inherent in drug abuse. For instance, armed robbers and the like operate under drug influence which make them to be bold and ruthless in their nefarious activities. It is obvious that drug abuse has posed a lot of dangers to our society, and government as a matter of urgency should do something to nip the problem in the bud.\nIt is now pertinent that everyone needs to be educated on the dangerous consequences of drug abuse. Mass enlightenment campaigns should be organized by government. Besides. government should promulgate a law which forbids the sale of drugs in open market places and by unauthorized hawkers and unlicensed medicine peddlers. There should also be a law which forbids a chemist from selling drugs to people without prescription paper from a doctor or a pharmacist.\nReligious bodies also have a role to play in this matter. They should rise up to educate their members on the side effects of drug abuse. and ensure that members are well monitored in their activities.\nMoreover, parents and guardians have a lot to do concerning the proper upbringing of their children. They should always remember the saying that charity begins at home What their children are doing either at home or schools should be monitored. Parents should be able to inculcate good morals into their children and make then realize the dangerous consequences of drug abuse on someone s life.\nTunde Iwaloye\nSS 2a.",

For about five years that I have been in secondary school, the news from home have been fascinating. Although I had been in my home town before, but I was young then and as a little boy, it would be difficult to recall the experiences I had for some years. My parents were afraid if I would be able to travel alone without anyone accompanying me. I made them to understand that the journey would not only be a safe one, but as an SS 3 student, I am matured enough to trace my steps back home.\nI got to the motor park early in the morning in order to catch the first bus that would be going to Port Harcourt. As usual, the motor park was filled with prospective passengers who were waiting to board buses to their various destinations. One could hear the sound of vehicle horns and the hustle and bustle of people within and outside the park. Eventually, I got inside the luxurious bus and after all the processes had been observed, the bus was cleared to move out of the park enroute its destination. Just after about an hour, the vehicle had left the shores of two states and everyone was elated that the driver would be at our final destination soon.\nAs the journey continued, the bus was no longer moving as fast as it was when we started the journey. Passengers were worried over this development. When people could no longer keep quiet, one man spoke out and called the attention of the driver, who allayed passengers' fear that sometimes, the bus used to move slowly after some hours on the road. His response brought disquiet among the passengers who wondered why a bus should suddenly slow down its speed after some hours. People were not comfortable with his explanation and he was rather casual in his response. Everyone remained calm as the bus moved, but somebody perceived an unpleasant and foul odour and called on the attention of others. He quickly walked towards the back seat of the bus and saw smoke coming out of the engine compartment. He shouted and called on the driver to stop. The latter was defiant as he sped on, but when all the passengers shouted at him, he applied the brake and the bus stopped.\nAfter the bus came to a halt and the passengers alighted, the driver went to open the engine compartment. What he saw there shocked him, because the smoke that blew to him at first drove him back. When the engine cooled down after about thirty minutes, and it was examined, it was discovered to the surprise of the driver and passengers. that a major damage had taken place. Many of the passengers, especially those who said they were hurrying to meet up with appointments in their destinations, were furious when told that the bus could no longer continue with the journey. The driver had to start appealing to them, while at the same time making frantic efforts to secure another bus for the now stranded passengers.\nEveryone agreed that if the driver had heeded advice and stopped the bus earlier to examine the noticed fault, the damage to the engine might not have been too serious, and the bus could still make it to its destination This supports the saying that a stitch in time saves nine",

Here was a village boy of yesteryear, an orphan from early life, cheated out of his heritage by his half-brothers and uncles whose actions forced him to \u00a0fend \u00a0for himself. So, how did he become an internationally acclaimed computer wizard?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When his well-to-do father died three years after his mother, he had just gained admission to a fee-paying secondary school. Had his parents lived, that would not have been a problem. But his closest relatives were more interested in sharing assets than handling liabilities. They shared the three buildings in the city, as well as several cocoa plantations with hundreds of oil palms. None considered \u00a0it right to take on the care of the poor boy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Left in the lurch, he clung on to a classmate who had longed to work in the city as a petty clerk. They moved to the city. Both were engaged by a big-time retailer in all sorts of goods. which he gave out to the boys to hawk on the busy roads.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There were no salaries; all they had were commissions from each day's sales. Musa and his friend could be out in the street from 6.00.a.m. till almost midnight. That way. they were able to keep body and soul together.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Musa soon decided that his returns could cater for a little more than that. His yearning for education still very keen, he cut short his daily schedules at 4.00 p.m to attend an evening school organized by some secondary school teachers. And he made very rapid progress.

However, persistent fuel scarcity had made the commodity hardly affordable where it was available. Fetching dry wood from the forest became inevitably the order of the day.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Early one morning Jojo and I. armed with cutlasses and axes, joined other young people, who were more conversant with the forest, in search of dry wood It soon dawned on us that this \"essential commodity\" had been driven so far away that we had to wander into the heart of the forest before we could fine a huge branch of tree that looked dry. Convinced that it was. we went into action. each cutting from his own side.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scarcely had we started when Jojo suddenly jumped up from her position and exclaimed \"Goodness!\" When I inquired what had happened. she explained that the ground on which she was standing was lifting her up This sounded weird and I went closer to examine the ground. It appeared level and was full of dry leaves. There was no sign of anything other than the bare ground. Mockingly, \u00a0I asked her to return to work, adding that her phobia about the forest was changing into an illusion. Nevertheless. I struck the ground with my cutlass cutting through it to reassure her that there was nothing to fear. But before I could leave we noticed blood trickling out of the cut on the ground and we scampered away, developing goose-flesh.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we watched from the distance, \u00a0we observed that there was a writhing movement and gradually. a curled creature stretched into full length of about three and a half feet. The earthy but splendid design of the skin became visible and it started what was like its last struggle away from the spot Its pace was decreasing with every effort to crawl on while more blood was being lost as a result of the deep cut it had received.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether it was shock or fear that prevented me from finishing up what I started, I cannot say. But though we accomplished our aim of going to the forest that day.

However, this can cause a lot of problems, as changing circumstances often make a change in lifestyle inevitable. Take for example, \u00a0people who leave their country and go abroad for various reasons. Such people will inevitably face many challenges. First they have to adapt to a new culture and habits that are completely different from what they were used to in their. own country. They will also have to adapt to the weather and may need to learn a new language, or now, communicate regularly in a language other than their mother tongue, which they used more frequently before their relocation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again, at some point in their lives, some people may have cause to change their career. The reasons for this may be varied and need not concern us here. But career changes inevitably necessitate the acquisition of a different set of skills and. experience in the new job, a new routine and adaptation to new friends and colleagues at work . In the face of economic recession and related circumstances, people may lose their jobs as the organizations they work for try to adjust to the ,adverse situation by retrenching many of their workers. (Terms such as -down-sizing\",\" right-sizing and restructuring\" are the modern-day euphemisms for this phenomenon!) A worker who suddenly loses his or her job obviously has to adjust to a new lifestyle - at least until a new job comes along.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Closely related to job loss is retirement. Many people carry on at their jobs as if they will remain. at such jobs forever. But retirement is inevitable not only for the paid worker but also the self-employed. Retirement in most cases means a change from an active working life to a more sedentary lifestyle. It often requires giving up official property such as accommodation and vehicles and the replacement of a regular salary with a modest pension, which may not be regular. Because of these, the prospect of retirement is often viewed with apprehension by many. as they are not prepared for it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Outside the work domain, other changes inevitably continue to take place. For example, at some point in their lives, young men and women come together and get married and start their own families. The transition from bachelorhood or spinsterhood of course means adaptation to a spouse. raising children and discarding many of the habits, often reckless and impulsive, of unmarried life.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, as painful and undesirable as it is, death is inevitable. The untimely loss of a loved one - a wife, a husband. a parent - often turns people's lives upside down. and necessitates a drastic change in lifestyle. Many people never anticipate such a loss. and if unfortunately it does occur. it can be quite devastating. ' n conclusion people have to be l ready for any changes that may occur in their lives. as change is inevitable and there is no guarantee for anyone that life will be stable forever.\n(a) In six sentences, one for each. summarize the six factors that can cause a change in lifestyle as discussed in the passage.",
