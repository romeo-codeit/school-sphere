The vision of the Managing Director, Dr. Rock Bansco was that the Company would become the leading supplier of office machines. He also hoped that the company would provide employment for many secondary school leavers.\nWithin the first five years of the company's inception, its profit grew rapidly. The customers increased so much that by the sixth year of the company's operation, the staff strength had become more than one hundred. However, all the workers who were employed in its sixth year of operation were both unqualified and inexperienced, worse still, they were given supervisory positions because of their relationship to the Managing Director in one way or the other.\n\nAs a large company, OKF Limited had six Heads of Department. However, the Managing Director hardly involved any of them in the day-to-day running of the company. He did all recruitment, purchases as well as salaries and wages administration. Staff salaries and wages were also very poor. As time went on, virtually all the staff became unhappy and this affected their morale.\n\nThe Managing Director recently called an emergency meeting to address the staff, surprisingly, he did not appoint anyone to record the proceedings of the meeting.\n\u00a0\na) State two problems in OKF Limited.\nb)\u00a0Outline departments in OKF Limited that should be responsible for the following activities:\n\nrecruitment of workers\nsales promotion\nacquisition of machines\npayments\n\nc) i) When is an emergency meeting called by the management of an organisation?\nii)\u00a0What is the meeting's related title of the officer who should have recorded the meeting proceedings?\niii)\u00a0State two duties the officer in (c)(ii) should have carried out before the day of the meeting\niv)\u00a0List five headings under which the officer would have recorded the proceedings of the meeting.",
