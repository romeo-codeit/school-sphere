    "correct_answer": "(a) The war between the Israelites and the Canaanites during the time of Deborah started when Israel cried to the Lord following the oppression that came from the Canaanites. God raised Deborah, a prophetess, who following God's instructions, summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh. When Barak arrived, Deborah informed him that the Lord God of Israel had commanded him to gather at Mount Tabor ten thousand men from the tribe of Zebulun and the tribe of Naphtali. She added that God had promised to draw Sisera (the general of the army of King Jabin of Canaan), to meet Barak by the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops. Deborah concluded by confirming that God would give victory to Barak. Barak insisted that he would go to battle on the condition that Deborah went with him. Deborah agreed to go with Barak, pointing out that the glory of victory would not go to Barak but to a woman chosen by God. Barak summoned his army \u2014 ten thousand men and Deborah went up with him to Mount Tabor.\nOn hearing that Barak had gone up to Mount Tabor, Sisera called up his men to war against Barak and Deborah. Deborah ordered Barak, \"up! For this is the day the Lord has given Sisera in to your hand\". In response, Barak went down with his army against Sisera and the Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots / army before Barak. Sisera, having lost his entire army, fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber, who offered him hospitality. While Sisera slept, Jael drove a tent peg into his temple and he died.\n(b) Ways Christians can benefit from Deborah's leadership qualities are:\n(i) Deborah was courageous and intelligent: This can be seen in the manner she handled the affairs of the war. She convinced Barak to obey God's command and eventually humiliated the Canaanite army.\n(ii) Deborah was obedient and humble: She responded to God's call. She allowed God to use her as an instrument of victory hence she did not complain when God sent her to Barak / she trusted in God.\n(iii) She motivated Barak to go to war by agreeing to go with him. She served as a source of motivation / inspiration.\n(iv) Deborah proved that God can use a woman as an instrument.\n(v) Patriotism \u2014 Deborah demonstrated patriotism by fighting for her nation. She defended the territorial integrity of Israel.\n(vi) Deborah proved that the feminine gender is no handicap in accomplishing onerous tasks \u2014 what matters is the determination",

A little girl from the land of Israel who was living with Naaman's mistress told her about the prophet in Israel, who could cure Naaman of his leprosy. Naaman informed the king of Syrian, who gave him a letter to the king of Israel. He went to Israel with the letter and lots of expensive presents. He gave the letter to the king of Israel, who rent his clothes after reading and asked if he was God who could kill and keep alive. He became afraid, thinking that the king of Syria was looking for a way to attack him. Elisha, the man of God heard the news and sent for Naaman. As Naaman stepped at the door, Elisha sent his messenger to tell Naaman to go and wash himself seven times in River Jordan. At first, he hesitated, but was later persuaded by his servant to heed the instruction.

Therefore, believers should be prepared at all times. As children of the day / light, believers should be on guard and not asleep as others.

The hope of salvation should motivate every Christian to prepare for the Lord's coming. This is because the Lord has decided to save us through our Lord Jesus Christ and not to destroy us in His anger. Christ died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep, we might be with him in the hereafter / eternally. Christians are to encourage one another and to build one another up explaining why preparations should be made for the second coming.\n(b) Significance of the Second Coming;\n(i) The second coming is a time when God will intervene directly and dramatically in world affairs.\n(ii) The day of punishment for sinners and reward for faithful believers.\n(iii) The day Christ will judge sinners and set up his eternal kingdom.\n(iv) The day God will defeat all the forces of evil.",
