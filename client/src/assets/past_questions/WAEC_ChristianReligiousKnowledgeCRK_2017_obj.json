    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "After all the terrible frogs, flies, calamity, and death that God sent to the Egyptians, Pharaoh was ready for the Israelites to leave. The Egyptians even gave the Israelites silver, gold, jewelry, and clothing. The Egyptians gave them anything they asked for. They really wanted them to leave!\nVery quickly, the Israelites packed their animals and began their trip to the place God would show them. God told Moses exactly which way to go and promised to be with His people. God provided a huge cloud to lead the people during the day and another cloud of fire to lead them at night. God was always with them. The people were excited about their new home.\nSoon after the Israelites left, Pharaoh became angry that he had let them go. He decided to go after them and bring them back to Egypt. Pharaoh gathered his soldiers, chariots, and horsemen and set out to catch the Israelites. They had to ride fast to catch up with God\u2019s people.\nMoses and the Israelites had walked a long way and were almost to a great body of water called the Red Sea! Now the Egyptians were behind them and the great sea was in front of them. What would they do? They cried out saying, \u201cWe are afraid!\u201d God told Moses to tell the people, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, I will take care of you.\u201d\nGod told Moses He was going to do something that would make both the Israelites and the Egyptians know He was God. He told Moses to hold up his staff over the sea. When Moses held up the staff, the water of the sea parted and left a dry path for all of God\u2019s people to walk safely across.\nThe Egyptians saw this and decided to follow. But God told Moses, \u201cStretch out your staff again.\u201d Moses obeyed, and the waters went back over the path and the Egyptians were no longer able to hurt the Israelites.\nWhen the Israelites saw this great power that the Lord God used against the Egyptians, the people knew that God was a great God. They sang a song to God. They said, \u201cI will sing to the Lord, for He is highly exalted\u201d (Ex. 15:1b).\nHighlights:\nThe pillars of cloud and fire provided assurance of God\u2019s direction as well as His presence as they made their journey. God\u2019s direction and His presence are two fundamental elements of biblical theology\u2026 God is a God who reveals His will and He is always present.God led His people in such a way that a miraculous and dramatic deliverance through the Red Sea would be necessary. This was done so both the Egyptians would come to know He is God (Ex. 14:4,17) and the Israelites would believe in Him (Ex. 14:31). God is always in control to accomplish His greater purposes.The bottom line reality we should carry from the story of the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea is that God is the sovereign Lord over all people and the gods we create. The showdown that God orchestrated here was specifically designed and intended to demonstrate His sovereign and unequalled power over all people as well as nature itself.",
