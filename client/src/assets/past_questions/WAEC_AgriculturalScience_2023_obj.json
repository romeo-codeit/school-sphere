    "explanation": "The gestation period for a sow (female pig) is approximately 3 months, 3 weeks, and 3 days, which is equivalent to about 114 days.If the sow was serviced (mated) on May 1, we can calculate the expected date of parturition (giving birth) as follows:Count 3 months from May 1: May + 3 months = August 1Count 3 weeks from August 1: August 1 + 3 weeks = August 22Count 3 more days from August 22: August 22 + 3 days = August 25So, based on the gestation period, the expected date of parturition is around August 25. However, since not all months have the same number of days, we need to adjust for the extra days to reach the actual parturition date.Counting from August 25 to September 30, there are 36 days (25 days in August and 5 days in September).
