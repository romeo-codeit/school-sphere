At high temperatures, the carbon in coke combines with the oxygen in the iron ore, forming carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "explanation": "Water is considered a \"universal solvent\"\u00a0because of its polar molecular structure, which allows it to dissolve a wider range of substances than most other liquids due to its ability to interact with both positive and negative charges of other molecules, effectively breaking them apart and dissolving them in water;\u00a0essentially, it can dissolve more substances than any other liquid.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Saturated.\nWhen a crystal of a salt is added to a saturated solution of the same salt, the crystal does not dissolve, and the solution remains unchanged. This indicates that the solution has reached its maximum capacity to dissolve the salt, and no more salt can be dissolved.\nA saturated solution is a chemical equilibrium state where the rate of dissolution of the solute equals the rate of precipitation. In this case, the solution is already holding as much dissolved salt as it can, so the added crystal doesn't dissolve.\nThe other options are not correct:\nA. Supersaturated solutions are unstable and can't persist indefinitely. If a crystal were added to a supersaturated solution, it would trigger precipitation.\nB. Concentrated solutions have a high amount of solute dissolved in the solvent, but this doesn't necessarily mean the solution is saturated.\nC. Unsaturated solutions have the capacity to dissolve more solute. If a crystal were added to an unsaturated solution, it would dissolve.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "explanation": "Heat of combustion (\u0394H\u00b0c) is the energy released when a substance is burnt in oxygen.\nThe heat of formation (\u0394H\u00b0f) is the energy released or absorbed when a substance is formed from its constituent elements.\nThe chemical equation is\u00a0 \u00a0 H\\(_2\\)\u00a0 \u00a0+\u00a0 1/2 O\\(_2\\)\u00a0 \u2192\u00a0 H\\(_2\\)O\nSince the heat of formation of H\\(_2\\)\u00a0 is zero (\u0394Hf(H\\(_2\\)\u00a0) = 0 kJ/mol), and the heat of combustion of H\\(_2\\)\u00a0 is -285.8 kJ/mol, we can use the following relationship:\n\u0394Hc(H\\(_2\\)\u00a0) = \u0394Hf( H\\(_2\\)O) - \u0394Hf(H\\(_2\\)\u00a0)\nRearrange to solve for \u0394Hf( H\\(_2\\)O):\n\u0394Hf( H\\(_2\\)O) = \u0394Hc(H\\(_2\\)\u00a0) + \u0394Hf(H\\(_2\\)\u00a0)\n= -285.8 kJ/mol + 0 kJ/mol\n= -285.8 kJ/mol\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "explanation": "When sulphur dioxide (SO\u2082) reacts with an acidified solution of potassium permanganate (KMnO\u2084), the initially purple solution turns\u00a0colourless. The reason is because the reaction between SO\u2082 and KMnO\u2084 is a redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction.\u00a0SO\u2082 acts as a reducing agent, meaning it causes the reduction of another substance (KMnO\u2084), While the permanganate ion (MnO\u2084\u207b) in KMnO\u2084 is reduced to manganese(II) ions (Mn\u00b2\u207a), which are colourless.\nSO\u2082 is oxidized to sulphate ions (SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b), which are also colourless. So, the purple colour of KMnO\u2084 is due to the permanganate ion, and when this ion is reduced, the solution becomes colourless.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

The reason is because the carbon atom attached to the hydroxyl (-OH) group in a tertiary alcohol is already bonded to three other carbon atoms.\u00a0This means there are no hydrogen atoms available on that carbon for oxidation to occur.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
