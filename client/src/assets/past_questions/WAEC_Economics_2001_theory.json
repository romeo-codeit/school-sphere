It is the rate at which the central bank charges interest on commercial and other financial institutions for discounting bills of exchange or lending to commercial banks. If the central bank wants to curtail bank lending, it will raise its discount rate, thereby forcing other rates to rise. This will make lending unfavourable to the public, thereby reducing the volume of money in circulation.
