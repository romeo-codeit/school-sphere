    "correct_answer": "Itikaf is considered to be a type of spiritual retreat. During the last 10 days of Ramadan, many Muslims spend their days and nights at the mosque (masjid) in order to ensure that they are there for whichever night Laylat al-Qadr occurs. This is called itikaf. Literally translated, it is an Arabic word that means \"to isolate oneself and to stick or adhere to something.\"\nThree Types of Itikaf\nSunnah:This is the itikaf performed during the last 10 days of Ramadan.Nafl:Itikaf can be performed on any day/night of the year. This is considered to be a nafl (voluntary) act.Wajib:If you have made a vow to perform itikaf, then it is compulsory (wajib) that you do so. This could be making a vow to Allah, such as through niyyat (intention) to perform itikaf or a vow based on a condition. This means saying or thinking: \"If this thing happens, I will make itikaf for certain number of days.\"\nAs far as when a person should begin his or her itikaf, there seems to be a variance in opinion as well. There are a few hadiths that mention that the Prophet Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) would begin his itikaf at the time of Maghrib prayer, and many hadiths that mention that he would begin his itikaf at the time of Fajr prayer. So it depends upon the believer and his or her intentions.\nIf the intention is there to do so, itikaf could last only a few hours. For example, it is encouraged, but not mandatory, to be in a state of itikaf during the time of Fajr until the sun rises and to be in a state of itikaf from Maghrib until the end of Isha prayer.\nWhat Are the Conditions of Itikaf?\nBeing Muslim:The first condition to performing itikaf is that the person be Muslim. Also, note that children who have not reached an age of discernment (sin at-tamyiz) do not participate in itikaf. The child must be able to eat, dress themselves, and wash themselves without assistance. For those who follow the Hanafi school of thought, this is typically around the age of seven for boys and around the age of nine for girls.Must be of sound mind:What this means is that a person must be able to make reasonable and rational thoughts and decisions. To explain further, a person may not be drunk or under the influence of drugs that may alter their state of mind. Also, a person who has a mental illness where they cannot make decisions on their own does not perform itikaf.Niyyah:This means intention. One must have the intention to participate in itikaf for the sake of Allah, not for the sake of being seen by others. Your intention must be pure and focused on worshiping and pleasing Allah.Permission:Women need to ask permission from their husbands before performing itikaf.Performed in masjid:It is mentioned inSurat al-Baqarah 2:187that itikaf is performed in a masjid. While some may say it is okay to perform itikaf at home, especially for women, most scholars agree that this is simply not the case at all, because the Qur'an says otherwise.State of wudu:One must be in a state of wudu (purification/cleanliness) to participate in itikaf. If a person's wudu is nullified, such as using the bathroom, then the person must wudu before continuing itikaf. Although, if during sleep, one has what is called a wet dream, one's itikaf is not nullified but one must ghusl (full body purification) before continuing itikaf.Fasting:By most schools of thought, fasting is a requirement to perform itikaf. Itikaf is mentioned in the Qur'an in conjunction to the fasting of Ramadan. The Prophet Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) would always fast during the time of his itikaf. However, some believe that if a person has a medical condition, such as diabetes, that prevents him or her from fasting, that it is still permissible for that person to participate in itikaf. Please note that a medical condition differs from being ill, such as with fever or nausea.",

    "correct_answer": "Muhammad is born as a member of the tribe ofQurayshand the clan of H\u0101shim. His hometown ofMeccahouses an ancient and famous pilgrimage sanctuary, theKa\u02bfbah. Although founded byAbraham, worship there has over time become dominated bypolytheismandidolatry. Muhammad\u2019sconceptionis preceded by a dramatic crisis: his grandfather \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib narrowly fails toimplementa vow to sacrifice his favourite son and Muhammad\u2019s future father,\u00a0\u02bfAbd All\u0101h, an obviousadaptationof the biblical story of the binding ofIsaac(Genesis22). Muhammad himself is born in 570, the same year in which the South Arabian kingAbrahaattempts to conquer Mecca and is thwarted by a divine intervention lateralludedto in s\u016brah 105 of theQur\u02be\u0101n. Muhammad\u2019s father passes away before his birth, leaving him in the care of his paternal grandfather, \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib. At the age of six Muhammad also loses his mother\u00a0\u0100minah, and at eight he loses his grandfather. Thereupon responsibility for Muhammad is assumed by the new head of the clan ofH\u0101shim, his uncle\u00a0Ab\u016b \u1e6c\u0101lib. While accompanying his uncle on a trading journey toSyria, Muhammad is recognized as a future prophet by aChristianmonk.\nAt the age of 25, Muhammad is employed by a rich woman,Khad\u012bjah, to oversee the transportation of her merchandise to Syria. He so impresses her that she offers marriage. Khad\u012bjah is said to have been about 40, but she bears Muhammad at least two sons, who die young, and four daughters. The best known of the latter isF\u0101\u1e6dimah, the future wife of Muhammad\u2019s cousin\u02bfAl\u012b, whomShi\u02bfiMuslims regard as Muhammad\u2019s divinely ordained successor. Until Khad\u012bjah\u2019s death some three years before Muhammad\u2019s emigration (hijrah) to Medina in 622, Muhammad takes no other wife, even thoughpolygamyis common.\nMuhammad\u2019s prophetic initiation occurs at the age of 40. During a period of devotional withdrawal atop one of the mountains in the vicinity of Mecca, the angelGabrielappears to him in an awe-inspiring encounter and teaches him the opening verses ofs\u016brah96 of the Qur\u02be\u0101n: \u201cRecite in the name of your Lord who creates, / creates man from a clot! / Recite for your lord is most generous\u2026.\u201d Muhammad is greatly perturbed after this first revelation but is reassured by Khad\u012bjah and her cousin,Waraqah ibn Nawfal, a learned Christian who confirms Muhammad\u2019s prophetic status. Muhammad continues to receive revelations but for three years limits himself to speaking about them in private. When God finally commands him to take up public preaching, he initially encounters no opposition. However, after the Qur\u02be\u0101nic proclamations begin to deny the existence of gods other thanAll\u0101hand thereby to attack the religious beliefs and practices of theQurayshtribe, tensions arise between Muhammad and his small circle of adherents, on the one hand, and the remaining inhabitants of Mecca, on the other. As a result, some of Muhammad\u2019s followers are forced to seek temporary refuge with the Christian ruler ofEthiopia. For some years, the other chief clans of Mecca even refuse to trade and intermarry with Muhammad\u2019s clan, since the latter continues to offer him protection. Sometime after the end of thisboycott, one of the most famous events in the Prophet\u2019s ministry takes place: his so-calledNight Journey, during which he is miraculously transported toJerusalemto pray with Abraham,Moses,Jesus, and other prophets. From there Muhammad continues to ascend toheaven, where God imposes on him thefive daily prayersofIslam.\nAbout 619, both Khad\u012bjah and Muhammad\u2019s uncle Ab\u016b \u1e6c\u0101lib die, and another uncle,\u00a0Ab\u016b Lahab, succeeds to the leadership of the clan of H\u0101shim. Ab\u016b Lahab withdraws the clan\u2019s protection from Muhammad, meaning that the latter can now be attacked without fear ofretributionand is therefore no longer safe at Mecca. After failing to win protection in the nearby town of Al-\u1e6c\u0101\u02beif, Muhammad secures a pledge of protection from a representative number of the inhabitants of theoasistown of Yathrib, also known asMedina(from its Qur\u02be\u0101nic appellational-mad\u012bnah, \u201cthe town\u201d). This promise enables Muhammad and his followers to leave Mecca for Medina, which, unlike Mecca, is partly inhabited by Jewish tribes. Together withAb\u016b Bakr, the future firstcaliph, Muhammad is the last to depart. It is only because he is warned by Gabriel that he narrowly escapes an assassination plot by the Quraysh.\nAt Medina, Muhammad has a house built that simultaneously serves as a prayervenuefor his followers. He also drafts acovenantthat joins together \u201cthe Believers and Submitters [or Muslims] of Quraysh and of Yathrib\u201d as well as some of Medina\u2019s Jewish tribes into acommunity(ummah) recognizing Muhammad as the \u201cMessenger of God.\u201d However, relations with the Jews of Medina steadily worsen. Eighteen months after the emigration, a revelation bids the Muslims to pray in the direction of the Meccan Ka\u02bfbah, rather than to continue facing toward Jerusalem as is Jewish practice. At about the same time, the Medinan Muslims begin raiding Meccan caravans. When, during one of these raids, they are surprised by a Meccan relief force at Badr in 624, the Muslims, aided by angels, score a surprising victory. In response, the Meccans try to capture Medina, once in 625 in the\u00a0Battle of U\u1e25ud and again in 627 in the so-calledBattle of the Trench; both attempts to dislodge Muhammad are ultimately unsuccessful. After each of the three major military encounters with the Meccans, Muhammad and his followers manage to oust another of the three main Jewish tribes of Medina. In the case of the last Jewish tribe to be displaced, theQuray\u1e93ah, all adult males are executed, and the women and children are enslaved.",

    "correct_answer": "Verse 5\nThis verse literally means: 'Thee alone do we worship, and Thee alone do we implore for help.' This is the fifth verse of theSurah. The author of the Commentary, giving a descriptive translation writes:\n\"The (verse)Iyy\u0101ka na\u2019budu wa iyy\u0101ka nasta\u2019\u012bnmeans: O Thou Lord of perfect attributes and source of the four graces, we worship Thee alone and in the due performance of duty of worship and in other calls and needs we seek only Thy help. Thou art our only God and in order to reach Thee we choose no other deity as our medium, neither man nor idol, nor do we rely on our wisdom or our knowledge; in everything we implore Thee, the Absolute Almighty, for help.\"\nVerse 6\nGuide us to the straight path . . . nor of those gone astray:The meaning of\u201cal-hidayah\u201d(\u0627\u0644\u0647\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0629= guidance, to guide) may easily be understood, if we consider first the significance of the \u201cpath\u201d.\u201cas-Sirat\u201d(\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0637= path) is synonymous withat-tar\u012bq(\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642) andas-sab\u012bl(\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0651\u0628\u064a\u0644).\nIn these verses, Allah has commended the path that it is straight and that it is the path taken by those upon whom Allah has bestowed His bounties and favours. It is this path guidance to which has been asked for.

    "explanation": "Verse 5\nThis verse literally means: 'Thee alone do we worship, and Thee alone do we implore for help.' This is the fifth verse of theSurah. The author of the Commentary, giving a descriptive translation writes:\n\"The (verse)Iyy\u0101ka na\u2019budu wa iyy\u0101ka nasta\u2019\u012bnmeans: O Thou Lord of perfect attributes and source of the four graces, we worship Thee alone and in the due performance of duty of worship and in other calls and needs we seek only Thy help. Thou art our only God and in order to reach Thee we choose no other deity as our medium, neither man nor idol, nor do we rely on our wisdom or our knowledge; in everything we implore Thee, the Absolute Almighty, for help.\"\nVerse 6\nGuide us to the straight path . . . nor of those gone astray:The meaning of\u201cal-hidayah\u201d(\u0627\u0644\u0647\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0629= guidance, to guide) may easily be understood, if we consider first the significance of the \u201cpath\u201d.\u201cas-Sirat\u201d(\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0637= path) is synonymous withat-tar\u012bq(\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642) andas-sab\u012bl(\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0651\u0628\u064a\u0644).\nIn these verses, Allah has commended the path that it is straight and that it is the path taken by those upon whom Allah has bestowed His bounties and favours. It is this path guidance to which has been asked for.

    "correct_answer": "Parent-Child Relationship in Islam- Rights of Parents (and Duties of children)Islam recognises family as a basic social unit. Along with the husband-wife relationship the Parent-child relationship is the most important one. To maintain any social relationship both parties must have some clear-cut Rights as well as obligations. The relationships are reciprocal. Duties of one side are the Rights of the other side. So in Parent-child relationship the Rights of parents are the obligations (duties) of the children and vice versa, the Rights of children are obligations (duties) of parents. Islam clearly defines the Rights of Parents (which mean duties of children) and obligations of parents (which means Rights of children).It is clear that after Allah parents are the persons who give us innumerable favors. They provide protection, food and clothing to the newly born. The mother sacrifices her comforts and sleep to provide comfort to her children. The father works hard to provide for their physical, educational and psychological (and spiritual) needs. It is a matter of common courtesy that if a person does you some favor you feel obliged to him. Verbally you say 'thank you' to him. You try to repay and compensate him for his gifts and favors. You feel a sense of gratitude towards him. So it is with Allah and with parents. Allah's favors cannot be counted or repaid except by thanking Him and obeying His orders. After Allah our parents deserve our thanks and obedience for the favors they had done us. That's why Quran lays stress on feeling grateful to parents, and doing good to them. \"And your Lord has ordained that you shall worship none save Him and shall do your parents a good turn.\" What does a 'good turn' mean? It includes obeying them, speaking softly, avoiding harsh words or harsh tone, giving them company when they are lonely, caring for their physical and psychological needs (especially in their old age), and praying to Allah that He may bless them and have mercy on them.As between parents the mother has more rights than the father. The reason is apparent. Mother has borne the child's burden during pregnancy, has undergone birth pains in delivering the baby, has sacrificed her own comforts to provide comfort to her children, has looked after them and felt worried for their well-being. That is why mother deserves our good treatment more than the father. A Tradition of the Prophet (PBUH) tells us that a Companion asked the Prophet, \" Who deserves my good treatment most?\" \"Your mother\", said the Prophet. \"Who next?\" \"Your mother\". \"Who next?\" \"Your mother\". \"Who after that?\" \"Your father\". This means that the mother deserves three times more good treatment from her children than the father deserves. Another Tradition wants us to extend kind treatment to close relations on the mother's side also (even to her friends). A famous Hadith (Tradition) says, \"Paradise lies under the feet of the mother\". This means doing good to our mother lead us to Paradise.As to the reward for doing good to our parents a Hadith mentions the following story: \"Three persons of ancient days were once traveling in a mountaneous region. The rain, thunder and lightning made them take refuge in a cave. Mudslide made a stone block the opening to the cave. The persons were entrapped inside. When the storm stopped they tried to push back the heavy stone to get out of the cave but they could not. They wondered 'what to do now'. At last seeing that their joint efforts also cannot move the stone they decided to pray to Allah sincerely. One of them suggested, 'each one of us should relate one good thing he has done in his life and beg Allah to move the stone. One said, \"One night my old mother asked me to bring a cup of milk for her. During the time I milched the goat and brought it to her she had gone to sleep. I did not think it proper to disturb her. So I stood by her bedside for the whole night till she got up in the morning and then I offered her the cup of milk. O God, if this act of mine was approved by You please shift this stone.\" The stone slipped a little but not enough to let them get out. Similarly, the second and the third man mentioned an act of goodness and prayed to God to shift the stone. The stone slipped down and the entry to the cave opened up. So the men got out. This story shows how service to one's parents leads to blessings from God and rescue from troubles. Now let us summarize the Rights of Parents (Duties of children):(1) Right to be respected and obeyed:Parents have a right to be respected and obeyed by children. All parents are well wishers of children. They issue orders and instructions that are in the best interest of children (though children might think ottherwise). So it is the duty of children to obey their orders and act accordingly. Some children listen to parental orders but do not act upon these or show laziness in carrying out these orders. This causes annoyance to parents. Children should remember that annoying one's parents can lead to God's wrath.(2) Right to scold and rebuke:It is instinctive obligation of parents to protect their children from physical and moral harm. If a small child puts its hand in fire it is natural urge for you to push the child back, even if the child does not want. It is in child's interest. So it is with parents. They are duty bound to protect their children in every way, physical, intellectual, moral. If the children have a temptation to do an act that is not in their long-term interest it is the duty of the parents to keep them back from that act or behavior. To this end they may resort to advice, rebuke, scolding, even hitting them. Good children should take all this 'harshness' in their own interest. If parents scold them they should bear it calmly. No rude replies, no arguing, no explanations, no comments unless asked for. Parental advice should be listened to and acted upon, even if against children's own wishes.(3) Right to be looked after.Parents have looked after the children for decades. So it is the duty of grown-up children to repay them by way of caring for them and looking to their physical and financial needs. A Quranic verse says: \"People ask you (O Prophet) how should they spend. Say, 'whatever you spend should be spent on Allah (in good cause), on parents, near relatives, on orphans, destitute and travelers (who fall short of money in foreign lands)\".(4) Right to be helped:As parents grow old their energies also decline. So it is the duty of children to help their parents in any household chore in which they can help. Sons can help in lifting heavy things, cleaning home, arranging things etc. Daughters can help in mother's household work-cooking, washing, cleaning, serving food etc. With good children such help should come automatically, not when asked for. Whenever you see your mother or father doing something extend a helping hand to her/him without their asking. This is what Islam expects from children.(5) Right to kind words/good behaviour:Quran urges children to be soft-spoken towards parents and show respect and kindness in their behavior towards parents.Unfortunate as it is, the Western societies have forgotten these lessons. Young children are rude towards parents and show disobedience. As the parents grow old they drive them out from their homes and put them in \"Senior Citizens Homes\". Grown up children cannot spare time to attend to the needs of old parents. The busy Western life has led to a break-up of the family unit (so much upheld in Islam). As Muslims we expect our children to adhere to Islamic values and show respect, obedience, kindness, leniency and care towards parents, especially in their old age. Children must not forget the favors and sacrifices of their parents. As good mannered persons they must feel and remain obliged towards parents and try to repay them by kind words and deeds, even with money and material needs. These are the Rights of Parents due from their children (or the Duties of Children towards parents). These Rights and obligations are not found in Islam only. Such values are to be found in all true religions. Quran mentions Hazrat Yahya (John the Baptist) as \"kind towards his parents, not tough and disobedient\". Similarly Hazrat Isa (Jesus) is quoted saying to his people, \"God made me kind towards my mother (Mary) and did not make me tough and disobedient\". Hazrat Yousuf (Joseph), as a royal Minister in Egypt, called his old, poor parents from their far off home and offered them seats on a high platform (he did not feel shy of behaving in a kind manner to poor parents in the presence of his officials).(2) Rights of ChildrenNow let us see the other side of the coin. We have mentioned that Parent-child relation is a reciprocal one. The Rights of Parents (discussed above) are the Duties of children. Now let us see what are the Rights of Children (and Duties of Parents) in Islam. These can be summarized as under:(1) Children have the right to be fed, clothed and protected till they grow up to adulthood.. It is, primarily, the duty of the father to do that. Mother can provide help if necessary. Protection means protection against physical as well as moral and intellectual harm. Parents are duty bound to see that the child's personality develops in all fields. So if the parents have to resort to strictness for the sake of disciplining the children and protecting them from intellectually, morally and religiously undesirable behaviour, children should not resent their strictness. Let them perform their duty as parents. Children's duty is not to protest or be rude but to listen and obey. \"Their's not to question why; their's but to do and die\".(2) Right to education.In Islam education is not limited to bookish knowledge but includes moral and religious training also. It means healthy all-round growth of child's personality. Parents must not only provide for children's education in schools and colleges but should also take personal interest in their studies, helping them if they can. This gives children a feeling of 'working with the parents' and encourages them in studies. Parents should sacrifice their own comfort and social activities and must spare some time to take interest in children's studies, especially when they are young. Leaving children to the mercy of teachers or tutors is not a wise policy. And of course, parents should not forget or neglect imparting religious/moral training to children. A little sacrifice on part of parents will save children from moral disasters. Effective moral training comes not from sermons, advice and precepts but from parents' personal examples of good behaviour. It is a famous Tradition of the Prophet (PBUH) that acquisition of knowledge is a must for every Muslim boy and girl. Another Hadith says, \"The best of you is one who gives a good education (intellectual and moral) to his children\". Another Hadith lays stress on education of daughters. The Prophet (PBUH) once said, \"He who provides good upbringing to 3 daughters shall go to Paradise\". A man asked, \"what if one has only two daughters\". \"He also shall go to Paradise\". Another man asked, \"and what if one has only one daughter?\" \"He too\", replied the Prophet (PBUH).(3) Right to love and affection:Children have many psychological needs also. Small children need to be loved, caressed, kissed and hugged. The Prophet loved children greatly. He would allow his grandsons Hassan and Hussain (R.A) to ride his shoulders even during his prayers. In streets he would offer 'salaam' to children, play and cut jokes with them. Sometimes he would even kiss small children in the street. Once a Bedouin saw the Prophet kissing a small kid. Out of wonder he said, \"I have eight children but I never kiss them\". The Prophet remarked, \"What can I do if Allah has taken away love and compassion from your heart\". The Prophet would show special kindness to orphaned children. Some parents believe that being frank with children is not good from discipline point of view. This is wrong. Love and leniency can do much that fear and strictness cannot do. If leniency leads to rudeness on the part of children it should be mixed with strictness. That will tell the children that parents are basically kind but can be tough if children show rudeness and bad manners. Over-protection and over-care are undesirable. Let the child grow up as a responsible person. Only provide them guidance.(4) Right to be well provided (materially)A Hadith says, \"It is better for parents to leave their children well provided (financially) than to leave them in poverty\". This means that parents should not spend all that they have on their own comforts and luxuries but must make provisions for children's welfare after the parents die. These are brief outlines of the Rights and Duties of both parties in the Parent-child relationship. If the parents and children act according to these guidelines they can make the family environment most conducive to peace and satisfaction for the parents and healthy personality growth for children. May Allah bless us all. AMEN",
    "explanation": "Parent-Child Relationship in Islam- Rights of Parents (and Duties of children)Islam recognises family as a basic social unit. Along with the husband-wife relationship the Parent-child relationship is the most important one. To maintain any social relationship both parties must have some clear-cut Rights as well as obligations. The relationships are reciprocal. Duties of one side are the Rights of the other side. So in Parent-child relationship the Rights of parents are the obligations (duties) of the children and vice versa, the Rights of children are obligations (duties) of parents. Islam clearly defines the Rights of Parents (which mean duties of children) and obligations of parents (which means Rights of children).It is clear that after Allah parents are the persons who give us innumerable favors. They provide protection, food and clothing to the newly born. The mother sacrifices her comforts and sleep to provide comfort to her children. The father works hard to provide for their physical, educational and psychological (and spiritual) needs. It is a matter of common courtesy that if a person does you some favor you feel obliged to him. Verbally you say 'thank you' to him. You try to repay and compensate him for his gifts and favors. You feel a sense of gratitude towards him. So it is with Allah and with parents. Allah's favors cannot be counted or repaid except by thanking Him and obeying His orders. After Allah our parents deserve our thanks and obedience for the favors they had done us. That's why Quran lays stress on feeling grateful to parents, and doing good to them. \"And your Lord has ordained that you shall worship none save Him and shall do your parents a good turn.\" What does a 'good turn' mean? It includes obeying them, speaking softly, avoiding harsh words or harsh tone, giving them company when they are lonely, caring for their physical and psychological needs (especially in their old age), and praying to Allah that He may bless them and have mercy on them.As between parents the mother has more rights than the father. The reason is apparent. Mother has borne the child's burden during pregnancy, has undergone birth pains in delivering the baby, has sacrificed her own comforts to provide comfort to her children, has looked after them and felt worried for their well-being. That is why mother deserves our good treatment more than the father. A Tradition of the Prophet (PBUH) tells us that a Companion asked the Prophet, \" Who deserves my good treatment most?\" \"Your mother\", said the Prophet. \"Who next?\" \"Your mother\". \"Who next?\" \"Your mother\". \"Who after that?\" \"Your father\". This means that the mother deserves three times more good treatment from her children than the father deserves. Another Tradition wants us to extend kind treatment to close relations on the mother's side also (even to her friends). A famous Hadith (Tradition) says, \"Paradise lies under the feet of the mother\". This means doing good to our mother lead us to Paradise.As to the reward for doing good to our parents a Hadith mentions the following story: \"Three persons of ancient days were once traveling in a mountaneous region. The rain, thunder and lightning made them take refuge in a cave. Mudslide made a stone block the opening to the cave. The persons were entrapped inside. When the storm stopped they tried to push back the heavy stone to get out of the cave but they could not. They wondered 'what to do now'. At last seeing that their joint efforts also cannot move the stone they decided to pray to Allah sincerely. One of them suggested, 'each one of us should relate one good thing he has done in his life and beg Allah to move the stone. One said, \"One night my old mother asked me to bring a cup of milk for her. During the time I milched the goat and brought it to her she had gone to sleep. I did not think it proper to disturb her. So I stood by her bedside for the whole night till she got up in the morning and then I offered her the cup of milk. O God, if this act of mine was approved by You please shift this stone.\" The stone slipped a little but not enough to let them get out. Similarly, the second and the third man mentioned an act of goodness and prayed to God to shift the stone. The stone slipped down and the entry to the cave opened up. So the men got out. This story shows how service to one's parents leads to blessings from God and rescue from troubles. Now let us summarize the Rights of Parents (Duties of children):(1) Right to be respected and obeyed:Parents have a right to be respected and obeyed by children. All parents are well wishers of children. They issue orders and instructions that are in the best interest of children (though children might think ottherwise). So it is the duty of children to obey their orders and act accordingly. Some children listen to parental orders but do not act upon these or show laziness in carrying out these orders. This causes annoyance to parents. Children should remember that annoying one's parents can lead to God's wrath.(2) Right to scold and rebuke:It is instinctive obligation of parents to protect their children from physical and moral harm. If a small child puts its hand in fire it is natural urge for you to push the child back, even if the child does not want. It is in child's interest. So it is with parents. They are duty bound to protect their children in every way, physical, intellectual, moral. If the children have a temptation to do an act that is not in their long-term interest it is the duty of the parents to keep them back from that act or behavior. To this end they may resort to advice, rebuke, scolding, even hitting them. Good children should take all this 'harshness' in their own interest. If parents scold them they should bear it calmly. No rude replies, no arguing, no explanations, no comments unless asked for. Parental advice should be listened to and acted upon, even if against children's own wishes.(3) Right to be looked after.Parents have looked after the children for decades. So it is the duty of grown-up children to repay them by way of caring for them and looking to their physical and financial needs. A Quranic verse says: \"People ask you (O Prophet) how should they spend. Say, 'whatever you spend should be spent on Allah (in good cause), on parents, near relatives, on orphans, destitute and travelers (who fall short of money in foreign lands)\".(4) Right to be helped:As parents grow old their energies also decline. So it is the duty of children to help their parents in any household chore in which they can help. Sons can help in lifting heavy things, cleaning home, arranging things etc. Daughters can help in mother's household work-cooking, washing, cleaning, serving food etc. With good children such help should come automatically, not when asked for. Whenever you see your mother or father doing something extend a helping hand to her/him without their asking. This is what Islam expects from children.(5) Right to kind words/good behaviour:Quran urges children to be soft-spoken towards parents and show respect and kindness in their behavior towards parents.Unfortunate as it is, the Western societies have forgotten these lessons. Young children are rude towards parents and show disobedience. As the parents grow old they drive them out from their homes and put them in \"Senior Citizens Homes\". Grown up children cannot spare time to attend to the needs of old parents. The busy Western life has led to a break-up of the family unit (so much upheld in Islam). As Muslims we expect our children to adhere to Islamic values and show respect, obedience, kindness, leniency and care towards parents, especially in their old age. Children must not forget the favors and sacrifices of their parents. As good mannered persons they must feel and remain obliged towards parents and try to repay them by kind words and deeds, even with money and material needs. These are the Rights of Parents due from their children (or the Duties of Children towards parents). These Rights and obligations are not found in Islam only. Such values are to be found in all true religions. Quran mentions Hazrat Yahya (John the Baptist) as \"kind towards his parents, not tough and disobedient\". Similarly Hazrat Isa (Jesus) is quoted saying to his people, \"God made me kind towards my mother (Mary) and did not make me tough and disobedient\". Hazrat Yousuf (Joseph), as a royal Minister in Egypt, called his old, poor parents from their far off home and offered them seats on a high platform (he did not feel shy of behaving in a kind manner to poor parents in the presence of his officials).(2) Rights of ChildrenNow let us see the other side of the coin. We have mentioned that Parent-child relation is a reciprocal one. The Rights of Parents (discussed above) are the Duties of children. Now let us see what are the Rights of Children (and Duties of Parents) in Islam. These can be summarized as under:(1) Children have the right to be fed, clothed and protected till they grow up to adulthood.. It is, primarily, the duty of the father to do that. Mother can provide help if necessary. Protection means protection against physical as well as moral and intellectual harm. Parents are duty bound to see that the child's personality develops in all fields. So if the parents have to resort to strictness for the sake of disciplining the children and protecting them from intellectually, morally and religiously undesirable behaviour, children should not resent their strictness. Let them perform their duty as parents. Children's duty is not to protest or be rude but to listen and obey. \"Their's not to question why; their's but to do and die\".(2) Right to education.In Islam education is not limited to bookish knowledge but includes moral and religious training also. It means healthy all-round growth of child's personality. Parents must not only provide for children's education in schools and colleges but should also take personal interest in their studies, helping them if they can. This gives children a feeling of 'working with the parents' and encourages them in studies. Parents should sacrifice their own comfort and social activities and must spare some time to take interest in children's studies, especially when they are young. Leaving children to the mercy of teachers or tutors is not a wise policy. And of course, parents should not forget or neglect imparting religious/moral training to children. A little sacrifice on part of parents will save children from moral disasters. Effective moral training comes not from sermons, advice and precepts but from parents' personal examples of good behaviour. It is a famous Tradition of the Prophet (PBUH) that acquisition of knowledge is a must for every Muslim boy and girl. Another Hadith says, \"The best of you is one who gives a good education (intellectual and moral) to his children\". Another Hadith lays stress on education of daughters. The Prophet (PBUH) once said, \"He who provides good upbringing to 3 daughters shall go to Paradise\". A man asked, \"what if one has only two daughters\". \"He also shall go to Paradise\". Another man asked, \"and what if one has only one daughter?\" \"He too\", replied the Prophet (PBUH).(3) Right to love and affection:Children have many psychological needs also.
