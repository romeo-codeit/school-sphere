In his frustration, he employed the service of a witch who then summoned the spirit of Samuel.\nWhen Samuel appeared before Saul, he queried why Saul was disturbing him by summoning his spirit to which Saul responded that he was troubled because the Philistines had surrounded them and the spirit of God had departed from him and he need direction on what to do.\nSamuel then told Saul that God had left him and given his Kingdom to David because he did not obey\u00a0the voice of the LORD nor execute His fierce wrath upon Amalek. He also informed him that Saul and the whole of Isreal will be defeated by the Philistines.\nAt this point, Saul realized he just didn't have the philistines as enemies, but that the Lord has completely deserted him and left him at the mercy of his enemies.",

    "explanation": "In 1 Kings 18:41-45 (RSV), it describes how Elijah prayed for rain, and eventually, there was a heavy rainstorm:\n\"And Elijah said to Ahab, 'Go up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of the rushing of rain.' So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel, and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees. And he said to his servant, 'Go up now, look toward the sea.' And he went up and looked, and said, 'There is nothing.' And he said, 'Go again seven times.' And at the seventh time he said, 'Behold, a little cloud like a man's hand is rising out of the sea.' And he said, 'Go up, say to Ahab,'Prepare your chariot and go down, lest the rain stop you.''' And in a little while the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain.\"",
