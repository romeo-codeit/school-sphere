I referred to Ngozi as being mischievous because what she told me about you as regards the stolen money in our dormitory has been revealed to be untrue.

I a m very sorry to have joined others to accuse you wrongly which had made you to vow not to be on speaking terms with me again.\nChioma, I want to let you know that the quarrel has caused me a lot of things. In fact, it has strained my good relationship p with my mother. She keeps asking after you. wondering why you've not be visiting me during holidays. I didn't know that she loves you so much until she pestered me to tell her what happened between us. She promised to come and see you and she refused to give me money when I was coming back to school because of the quarrel between us.\nIn addition to this, I missed your companionship and the friendship that has been built over a period of five years.

It won't be good for us to meet after our stay in this school and refuse to greet each other.

The current wave of indiscipline among students is most disturbing and it demands immediate attention of all the stakeholders in the education sector. Indiscipline among students manifests mainly in various unruly behaviors exhibited by students in and outside the school. It includes untoward behaviors like violence street fighting and hooliganism, truancy at school, improper dressing even when they wear their uniforms. moral laxity, gambling and other immoral acts.\nIndiscipline in schools can be blamed on the parents who have neglected the discipline of their children at home. Nowadays. parents ignore their duties towards proper upbringing of their children little time is spent with these children which results in moral laxity which is exhibited by students. Many who are undisciplined are products of broken homes and careless parents. The home contributes mainly to indiscipline in our institutions of learning.\nApart from this, our society can not be exonerated either Indiscipline is a societal problem. It originates from our societal values which nowadays have been twisted and corrupted A society demands the type of students it gets. There is a lot of indiscipline acts going on in our society and this can not but rub off on our students.

I am here to argue in support of the motion that it is the home and not the school that contributes more to moral laxity among students'. The home is where a child is born brought up and first taught the ethics and norms of his society. The first place of socialization for a child is the home and the child spends most of his time at home than in school. The child spends relatively little time in school where he is taught to read, write and develop professional skills.Judging from the little explanations offered above, you would agree with me that the home is in the best position to educate students on what is morally right and wrong. However, the home has failed in its duty to bring up students to be morally upright. The attitude of most immoral students can be traced to their homes because students tend to exhibit the bad behaviour and attitude of their parents who, in most cases, are fond of fighting, corruption, immorality and other vices. It has been discovered that parents can not be exonerated from examination malpractices being perpetuated by students in schools. Some parents do encourage their children to be involved in examination malpractices.My opponent has said that when a child attends school, he picks up bad immoral traits which he will later exhibit but this is not true. I disagree with my opponent in the sense that if a child is properly brought up, trained and educated on\u00a0issues of morality from home, even when he comes in contact with bad influence, he will not be influenced negatives He will even detest such immoral and bad behaviour of his classmates.Moreover, parents who are in the best position to take care of their children's emotional needs are not there forth when the children need them most. They are concerned mostly with how to make money, parties and other mundane things which are detrimental to the moral upbringing of their children.In addition, watching violent movies, Pornography and such immoral pictures contributes largely to total moral breakdown and often emotional disorder of students Where else could they have watched such movies if not the homes? There is an adage which says that 'charity begins at home'. in the same vein, it could be said that moral laxity begins at home.In conclusion, the Chairman Sir, Panel of Judges, distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, I am sure that you have been convinced that it is the home and not the school that contributes more to moral laxity among students.

He was bent on getting to his office beforehis workers. The previous day, he had reprimanded his staff for regularly coming to work late, and threatened to give the sack to any of them who would repeat the offence. Today, he must get to work in time not only to serve as a role model but also to show that he really meant what he had said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He managed to squeeze himself behind the wheel of his car which was at least two sizes too small to accommodate his paunch. He inserted the ignition key and turned it but the car would not start; the engine just grumbled. On the second attempt, it coughed and finally roared to life on the third. It moved grudgingly to the gate and stopped. Cissey immediately realised that he would be caught in a traffic jam. It was evident \u00a0that he would arrive at his workplace late.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For about two hours, Cissey just sat, glued to his seat, fuming. Hard as he tried to control his temper, the misbehaviour of other drivers once prompted \u00a0him to bawl at them. Then suddenly, after the interminable wait, the street cleared and Cissey sped off. It was almost three hours after leaving home that he got to his workplace. The staff were already there and when he entered the building, he found his secretary and the clerical staff apparently immersed in their assignments, with an air of dutifulness. One look at their boss warned them that they had better keep quiet to save their skin. But as soon as he closed the door to his office he heard soft voices mumbling words he could not understand. Worst of all, he heard subdued laughter from his secretary.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cissey immediately shot out of the chair ready to vent his spleen on these underlings but suddenly plopped bac into his seat.

I am reminded of the popular slogan that this country belongs to us, for which reason every one of us must join hands in trying to salvage it. I try to dismiss the argument by reasoning that it is foolhardy \u00a0attempting to lend a helping hand where one's services are apparently not required. Then I am reminded that if I leave the country in a hurry just because of our political instability and economic hardship, my commitments to my nuclear family and extended family at home will suffer. I reply by saying that as soon as I get settled abroad. I would arrange for my famiiy to Join me. Other financial problems at home would be taken care of by my regular remittances. Would I then never think of going back home in future? Not until the situation in the country improved considerably, I would answer. And who do I expect to carry on with the task of national rehabilitation when the likes of me are all out of the country? Those who messed up the country in the first place, I would argue. And so on. This self-examination has been going on for the last ten years or so: meanwhile. I am yet to leave the country.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I wonder how many people think' as I do. I realize that we must\" be very few. Indeed, not many have the slightest opportunity of absconding \u00a0from the country; they do not have the place to run to, nor do they have the means of escape. Even among the elite who consider this possibility. the uncertainty of a future outside their fatherland intimidates them. And so we all end up staying and grumbling.\n(a) Why would the writer like to leave his country?\n(b) Why does the writer believe that he should not join in salvaging his country?'\n(c) What would make the writer return to his country?\n(d) Who does the writer suggest should carry on the task of national rehabilitation?\n(e) Give two reasons why it has not been easy for him and others to leave the country.\n(f) ...many answers rush to my mind.

    "text": "Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Have you always thought that insects are nothing more than a nuisance? Would you like the world to be free of these annoying pests ? Do you spray them swat them. or step on them at every opportunity? Before declaring war on every bug that crosses your path, why not try to learn something about their world? After all, with a population that outnumbers humans by about 200 million to one you can be sure that insects are here to stay! A brief look at just a few of these amazing creatures might well convince you that insects deserve your respect.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider flying insects for example: Mosquitoes can fly upside down. Some can even fly through the rain without getting wet - yes, actually dodging the raindrops! Some tropical wasps and bees buzz around at speeds of up to 72 kilometres per hour. One monarch butterfly of North America logged 3,010 kilometres on its migration flight. Hover flies can beat their wings more than a thousand times per second - much faster than humming-birds and dragon flies can fly backwards. Clearly then. insects are such accomplished fliers, unmatched by any other winged creature.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The eyes of many insects serve as a compass. Bees and wasps, for instance, can detect the plane of polarised light. This enables them to locate the sun's position in the sky - even when it is hidden by clouds. Thanks to this ability, these insects can forage far from their nests and still navigate their way home unerringly. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the insect world, sounds and aromas are often used to find a mate - no small achievement when prospective mates are few and far between. Female emperor moths find a suitor by emitting a scent that is so potent that a male can i home n on its source from nearly 11 kilometres away. Crickets, grasshoppers, and cicadas prefer to make themselves heard. Even we humans can hear the amorous cicada as it converts its whole body into a sounding board. A large group of courting cicadas can create a noise louder than that of a drilling machine!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insects play a vital role in our daily life, about 30 percent of the foods we eat results from pollination by them. But pollination is only one of their useful functions. Insects keep the earth clean by means of an efficient recycling system, as they reprocess dead plant and animals. Scientists have observed that without insects the earth will be inundated with dead plant and animal matter. Insects also enrich the soil by liberating nutrients that make things grow. They are sorely missed when their work is not done. Consider what happened in Australia, which has become home to millions of cattle. Herds scattered dung everywhere. Besides being unsightly, the dung provided a breeding site for the bush fiy - a plague to both humans and cattle. So dung beetles were imported from Europe and Africa, and the problem was solved!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Admittedly, some insects eat crops and carry disease. But only about one percent of the world's insects is considered as pests, and many of these cause damage because of the way man himself altered the environment. Even with their drawbacks, insects are an integral part of the natural world on which we depend. Scientists have pointed out that while insects can survive without us, we cannot survive without them.\n(a) In three sentences, one for each, summarise the characteristics of insects discussed in the passage.\n(b) In three sentences, one for each, summarise the important functions of insects discussed in the passage.",
