    "explanation": "Soldiers march disorderly while crossing a bridge to prevent resonance because when soldiers march in orderly manner across a bridge, they generate a rhythmic oscillation of wave on the bridge and at a certain point, would start oscillation to the same rhythm as that of the marching steps. This oscillation would reach a maximum peak when the bridge can no longer sustain its own strength and hence collapses. So for this reasons, soldier are ordered to march disorderly while crossing a bridge.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
