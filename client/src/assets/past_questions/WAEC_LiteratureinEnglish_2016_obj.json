In this poem, the speaker describes being at a crossroads, facing a decision to either leave or accompany someone. The choice is imbued with a sense of love and intimacy.\nThe use of phrases like \"You lifted the lamp of love\" suggests a positive and affectionate atmosphere. The image of the \"lamp of love\" conveys illumination and guidance, indicating that the decision is influenced by love and the emotions associated with it. Additionally, the speaker expresses seeing the road they should take in the face of the other person, which further enhances the romantic mood.\nThe overall tone of the poem is not sad, gloomy, or jubilant. Instead, it is infused with a sense of warmth, affection, and the contemplation of a romantic choice. Therefore, the mood of the poem is best described as romantic (option D).",
