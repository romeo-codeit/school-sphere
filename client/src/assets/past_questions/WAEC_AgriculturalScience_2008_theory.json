Examples of Fixed Cost Cost of farm buildings, Cost of structures (e.g silo,\u00a0barn etc), Cost of equipment, Cost of machinery\nVariable Cost: This is the other component of total cost which varies directly with the level of production.Examples of Variable cost Wages, Salaries, Cost of feed, Cost of Seeds, Cost of Fertilizers, Cost of agro-chemicals\n(c) Explanation of agricultural extension teaching methods(i) Posters- It is an illustrated sheet of paper or cardboard with a few words to briefly explain the illustration- The illustrations may be in the form of cartoons, pictures, tables or graphs- The illustrations or words are bold and in a few bright colours so they can easily be read- The messages should be simple and precise for easy understanding- Posters are to be mounted at vintage points to allow as many farmers as possible to see and learn from them\n(ii) Field trips- It is a planned visit by a group of farmers to places of agricultural importance such as a successful farmer's farm, demonstration farm, a research station or agricultural institution- Field trips are undertaken to observe in a real situation, recommend agricultural practices and inputs not locally available, and to obtain information directly from successful farmers etc.-During the trip, the attention of farmers is drawn to interesting things and important points- Back in their community, the group should meet and discuss what they saw and learnt.",
