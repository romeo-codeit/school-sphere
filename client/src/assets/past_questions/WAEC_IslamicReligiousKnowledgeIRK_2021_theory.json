    "correct_answer": "Within Islamic law, there is a doctrine known as Hadana that instructs Muslims how to deal with issues regarding a child's physical custody- what we in Nigeria may call possession of a child. Unlike in Nigerian civil law, this doctrine automatically grants physical custody of a child to the father.Let's examine specifically what the doctrine of Hadana has to say regarding the possession of a child. For starters, if a child is born out of marriage, then if you are the child's mother, you would be able to have physical custody of your child if he is a male up to the child's seventh birthday.On the other hand, if your child is a girl, you would be entitled to your daughter's physical custody until the age of puberty. Typically if your ex-husband were not able to take physical custody of your child at either age seven/the age of puberty, his relatives would be able to step in and take possession in his absence.As the natural guardian of your child, your ex-husband holds all the cards in terms of physical custody of your child. He would have the sole right to determine whether your child can travel internationally by obtaining a passport, where he or she would go to school, and other issues like this. In Nigerian divorces, parents will typically share in these rights and, in many cases, have an equal say in the rights and duties of parenting a child after divorce.You, as the mother of the child, can lose physical custody of the child before the aforementioned ages in a few different ways. For starters, if it is determined by an Imam (a religious leader within Islam) that you are untrustworthy as a parent, then your physical custody rights to your child could be stripped.Secondly, if it is determined that you are not competent to promote the religious faith of your child or to encourage their active following of Islam, then your physical custody rights may be in jeopardy. Finally, you may lose custody rights to your child if you remarry from outside of your husband's family during this time period before your child turns the age at which time he or she would go to live with their father.",

For this reason, some Imams of hadith, such as al Hakim and Ibn Hibban include hassanahadith with sahih hadith, while still acknowledging its lesser rank to the sahih.\n\u2192Da'if HadithA da'if hadith is a hadith which does not fulfil the conditions of the sahih or hassan hadith.Ruling: There is a difference of opinion between the 'ulema on the ruling on acting upon weak hadiths. The reliable opinion is that weak hadiths can be acted upon for virtuous supererogatory deeds (fada'il al a'mal), for religious exhortation, and stories, and similar things that are not connected to legal rulings and tenants of belief.It should also be noted that the meaning conveyed in a weak hadith may still be considered sound and supported by other related texts.\n\u2192A gharib hadith is one conveyed by only one narrator\n\u2192MashhurThe first category is mashhur ( meaning: famous).

The isn\u0101d of a hadith that appears to be mutta\u1e63il but one of the reporters is known to have never heard hadith from his immediate authority, even though they lived at the same time, is munqa\u1e6di\u02bb.

    "correct_answer": "- The Profession of Faith,; The ShahadaThe Profession of Faith, the shahada, is the most fundamental expression of Islamic beliefs. It simply states that \"There is no God but God and Muhammad is his prophet.\" It underscores the monotheistic nature of Islam. It is an extremely popular phrase in Arabic calligraphy and appears in numerous manuscripts and religious buildings.- Daily Prayers; SalatMuslims are expected to pray five times a day. This does not mean that they need to attend a mosque to pray; rather, the salat, or the daily prayer, should be recited five times a day. Muslims can pray anywhere; however, they are meant to pray towards Mecca. The faithful pray by bowing several times while standing and then kneeling and touching the ground or prayer mat with their foreheads, as a symbol of their reverence and submission to Allah. On Friday, many Muslims attend a mosque near midday to pray and to listen to a sermon, khutba.- Alms-Giving; ZakatThe giving of alms is the third pillar. Although not defined in the Qu'ran, Muslims believe that they are meant to share their wealth with those less fortunate in their community of believers.- Fasting during Ramadan; SaumDuring the holy month of Ramadan, the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, Muslims are expected to fast from dawn to dusk. While there are exceptions made for the sick, elderly, and pregnant, all are expected to refrain from eating and drinking during daylight hours.- Pilgrimage to Mecca; HajjAll Muslims who are able are required to make the pilgrimage to Mecca and the surrounding holy sites at least once in their lives. Pilgrimage focuses on visiting the Kaaba and walking around it seven times. Pilgrimage occurs in the 12th month of the Islamic Calendar.",
