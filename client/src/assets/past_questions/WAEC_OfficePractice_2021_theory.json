They came late to work and left before the closing time. As a result of this, the volume of production of the company reduced. This inturn, reduced the income of the organization so much that payments of workers' wages and salaries became difficult. Many experienced workers began to leave the firm for greener pastures.\n\nThe firm also found it difficult to meet its financial obligations to suppliers. On assumption of duty, Mr. Okonkwo quickly swung into action. He carried out an investigation to ascertain the causes of these problems. One of his findings was that workers bitterly complained about their conditions of service. Although their wages and salaries were acceptable, they asked for other benefits from the company which were denied them\n\nMr. Okonkwo also discovered that workers were employed without following due process. Finally, he found out that no measure was put in place to regulate the punctuality of workers. Armed with these finding, Mr Okonkwo addressed each of the issues and put in place adequate measures to ensure proper supervision and satisfaction of workers.\n\n(a).\u00a0Suggest one measure that Mr. Okonkwo could use to improve staff regularity at work\n(b).\u00a0\u00a0Apart from irregularity at work, state two other problems in Theolas International Company\n(c).\u00a0List six welfare packages that would improve workers satisfaction at Theolas International Company\n(d).\u00a0State four pre-employment activities the company should have carried out in recruiting its staff",
