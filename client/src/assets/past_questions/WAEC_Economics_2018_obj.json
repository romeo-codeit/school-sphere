Law of diminishing the marginal utilityThe law of diminishing marginal utility states that with each increasing quantity of the commodity, its marginal utility declines.For example, when a person is very hungry the first chapatti that he eats will give him the most satisfaction. As he will consume more chapattis, his level of satisfaction will diminish.Thus, when the quantity of goods is more, the marginal utility of the commodity is less. Thus, the consumer is not willing to pay more price for the commodity and its demand will decline.Also, when the price of the commodity is low, its demand increases.Hence, the demand curve slopes downwards from left to right.",

    "explanation": "There are five causes for demand-pull inflation:\nA growing economy: When consumers feel confident, they will spend more, take on more debt by borrowing more. This leads to a steady increase in demand, which means higher prices.Asset inflation: a sudden rise in exports, which translates to an undervaluation of the involved currenciesGovernment spending: When the government opens up its pocketbooks, it drives up prices. Military spending prices may go up when the government starts to buy more military equipment.Inflationexpectations: forecasts and expectations of inflation, where companies increase their prices to go with the flow of the expected riseMore money in the system: demand-pull inflation is produced by an excess in monetary growth or an expansion of the money supply. Too much money in an economic system with too few goods makes prices increase.",
