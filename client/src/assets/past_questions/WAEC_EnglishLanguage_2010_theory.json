    "correct_answer": "Omole Senior High School,Omole Phase 1.Omole, Ikeja.29th June, 2010\nDear Sheila,How are you and your studies? I hope that you are fine. The family has moved into a new neighbourhood. We moved a month after your departure to the United States of America. At first, I was happy that we were about to leave our former neighbourhood for a new one but, on getting there. I found out that I couldn't like the new neighbourhood. In fact, I dislike our new neighbourhood for some reasons.Firstly, the area is too boring for my liking. Residents of the neighbourhood are not lively. All they do is go out, come back and lock themselves in their flats. Unlike our former neighbourhood which was lively with children around to play with, our new area is boring to the extent that the streets are mostly desolate and deserted. The area has turned me to a prisoner. I no longer go out to visit friends because I don't have friends here. The fact is that there are no friendly people around. They just mind their business.Secondly, the area lacks necessary social amenities that can make life enjoyable. The area lacks electricity as well as good roads and other vital infrastructure. Apart from the fact that we always have stuffy and hot nights especially during dry season which force us to open our windows for mosquitoes, it is difficult for me to read my books at night. My only alternative is to purchase a lamp that is battery-powered.Apart from this, the neighbourhood is well known for armed robbery attacks. We have had up to ten armed robbery attacks in less than three weeks of our arrival. There is no peace and everybody in the neighbourhood is always scared and troubled because no one knows when the next attack will be. It has even got to a stage when armed robbers are no longer afraid of operating in the day time. For instance, there was an incident that occurred in our neighbourhood recently. One afternoon, a family was driving into our area at about six o' clock in the evening. About eight huge and fierce looking men stopped the car. The family was ready to leave everything for them but the robbers still went on to forcefully rob the family.As I earlier said. the place is a jungle and not fit for man to live. Unfortunately. I live there. I hope I do not turn into ' an animal one day. Please extend my greetings to your roommatesYours sincerely.Tosin.",

    "correct_answer": "VOCATIONAL TRAINING: A SOLUTION TO UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG YOUTHS.\nUndoubtedly unemployment is one of the banes of our country. Unemployment is particularly common among the youths despite the fact that most of them are graduates of one higher institution or the other. It is assumed that most of the youths are unemployable. Though they are educated. unfortunately, they are educated to be job seekers only and not job creators or employers. What this means is that they are not trained to make use of their hands hence they graduate from higher institutions to become suitable for white collar jobs only. Consequently, most of them become frustrated after searching for white collar jobs for several years without success.\nThis situation can be reversed if vocational training can be encouraged in and out of our educational institutions. Vocational training is the training received on a particular trade or occupation. For example, girls can be trained to become hair dressers. photographers and so on while our boys can be trained to be barbers, dry cleaners and fashion designers. Training in different vocations is the only panacea to unemployment as any youth who has undergone such training won't have to look for somebody to employ him. He will want to establish himself in the business with the assistance he can get from the government and his parents.\nBesides, a youth who is self-employed, due to the vocational training he has received, will train and employ other\u00a0youths. Through this, the rate of unemployment in our society will be reduced. As a result of this, there will be less pressure on government as government will be able to divert its attention to provision of infrastructure that will facilitate creation of obs. Vocational training, in this way, will make it possible for most of our youths to be producers of goods and services which when purchased will make life comfortable for them.\nFurthermore, through vocational training for our youths, many products like soap, detergent, pomade, air freshener and even hand set can be produced. This will make the country to become producers of goods which when improved upon can be exported to other countries of the world to earn foreign exchange for our country.\nIt is in the light of this that it is a matter of urgency for government to set up vocational centres in all the states in the country. This will enable the youths to come to these vocational centres to learn one trade or the other. Moreover, vocational training should be introduced in schools. This will give the youths the opportunity to learn one vocation or the other which they can fall back on when they are unable to get white collar jobs after graduation.\nVocational training is an efficient method of reducing unemployment through empowering youths economically by training them to use their hands to create job opportunities for themselves. If they are trained in one trade or occupation, they will establish small scale industries which will make them to be self-employed.\nDominic Adams.\nSS 3A 1.",

The majority of this lot were those with seemingly intractable mental health conditions. The superintendent of the prayer house in question was often spoken of in whispers as possessing uncanny spiritual powers to exorcise evil spirits. it was also believed that he had answers to numerous illnesses that defied orthodox medication. Wednesday of each week was set aside for these healing sessions.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 On this particular Wednesday, noisy supplications to the Most High and ceaseless invocation of His name to free those supposedly held captive by alleged evil spirits had reached fever pitch. Suddenly, a middle-aged man broke loose from the crowd and ran as fast as his wobbly legs could permit. Some male workers from the prayer house gave him a hot chase.\u00a0\nAt first, bemused by-standers rained curses on the fleeing man, wondering why a man in his right senses would in broad daylight rob a house of God. They obviously mistook the man for a robber fleeing from the scene of his crime. But he was not. Minutes later, he was caught and chained hands and feet, despite his struggle against his captors who intermittently lashed him with horse-whip. As he was being violently dragged along the street, the man ceaselessly muttered incomprehensible words that sounded like the muttering of a colony of baboons. Then, a clear picture of the situation dawned on the on-lookers. The man, after all, was not a thief and had stolen nothing; rather, his ability to think and reason properly had taken flight of him. Simply put, he was mentally deranged.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The above incident is a common occurrence in many parts of the country. It aptly underscores the devastating mental health conditions plaguing a sizeable number of people in recent times. It also points to the unspeakable and inhuman treatment which people with such health disorders suffer at the hands of self-styled spiritualists. This is the usual lot of mental patients whose family members refuse to take advantage of orthodox treatment.\u00a0\n(a) What brought the people to the prayer house?\n(b) State the functions of the superintendent of the prayer house.\u00a0\n(c) What was wrong with the on-lookers' assessment of the run-away man?\u00a0\n(d) Mention two instances of inhuman treatment in the passage.\u00a0\n(e) What is the writer's attitude towards the treatment of lunatics at prayer house?\u00a0\n(f)\"... like the muttering of a colony of baboons.\" What figure of speech is contained in this expression?\u00a0\n(g) \"...

There was a rush to volunteer which took her completely by surprise. When she recovered and had quietened our excited shouting, there was a moment during which none of us dared breathe, as she scanned the eager faces. What made her choose me i had never found out, but i had noticed before that she was partial to me. \"All right Karimu,\" she said. \"You can come, but first run along and get your father's consent\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My parents were only too glad to have one mouth fewer to feed and my brothers and sisters to see the back of one who inevitably, had begun to assume an air of superiority in talking to them. Miss Williamson's bungalow was a stone's throw from school. That very evening saw me installed on a mat in a corner of her back veranda. I was unable to sleep, excited at the thought of the good fortune that had come my \u00a0way. To be within earshot of Miss Williamson's English all day, to have access to her books, to nurse the possibility, overwhelming even in thought, of going with her frequently of Rofunkti - all these visions kept my eyes wide open and my brain racing until very late that night. With my \"lapa\" pulled right over my head and happy beyond all description in my heart, I smiled myself to sleep.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I learnt a very great deal in Miss Williamson's bungalow. Apart from improving my English, I learnt about the world outside and began to sense that were barriers much higher and much less easily gauged than those of mere language and colour, between my own people and those from whom she sprang. The smiling teacher in the daytime often became the brooding restless, ill-tempered spinster in the evening. Her bungalow was shared by another lady, a doctor, also a Scot, who traveled to and fro between the villages on a bicycle. I noticed that when not at their work or talking about it, these women showed no signs of being happy. As I grew up with them, i found myself wondering what had made them leave their country and come to live among a people whose ways were totally different from theirs.\n\u00a0\n(a) Why was Miss Williamson completely surprised?\n(b) Why was Karimu's family happy to see him go to stay at the bungalow?\n(C) State the overwhelming thought that kept Karimu awake.\n(d) What did Karimu find difficult to understand about the two ladies?\n(e) Mention the identical trait in these two ladies behaviour. \u00a0\n(f) \"What made her choose me. .\"\n(i) What grammatical name is given to this expression as it is used in the passage? ;\n(ii) What is its function?\n(g) \"I smiled myself to sleep.\"What is the meaning of this expression?\n(h) For each of the following words, find another word or phrase which means the same and which can replace it as it is used in the passage: (i) scanned; (ii) inevitably; (iii) nurse; (iv) vision; (v)gauged; (vi) brooding.",

    "text": "Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No one can deny the fact that anyone who wants to be successful in learning the English language needs a good English dictionary. Such a dictionary should be a source of information about the language \u2014 information that is not generally available in grammar books It should not only contain a list words and their meanings, but also a lot of information that can help a leaner to speak and write good English.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to use a word correctly, the reader needs to know how to link it with other words in a sentence. He should also know the structures that often precede or follow it, and whether it is formal or informal. This will help him to choose what word is appropriate for a particular context. The dictionary is therefore, an invaluable aid to reading as well as writing skills.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the meaning of a particular word in a passage impedes the overall comprehension of the main ideas presented in it, then a dictionary should be used. Most teachers must have observed a widespread tendency among their students to attack a new passage by reading it word by word, stopping to reach for a dictionary whenever they come across a word they do not know. This is a wrong approach; \u00a0the dictionary should be used only as a last resort. The main objective of reading a passage is not to define \u00a0specific words but to understand the ideas and concepts of the passage. the frequent use of a dictionary tends to focus the reader's attention on words when he should be concentrating on understanding the main ideas of the passage. Efficient reading implies obtaining the greatest amount of information from the passage in the shortest time possible. The frequent use of a dictionary takes too much time \u2014 time that can better be employed in getting an overall understanding of the passage.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead of turning to the last resort, the reader should continue reading. Very often, the meaning of an unfamiliar ford can be guessed from the context in which it is used. The passage may give a definition, cite examples or describe )e circumstances surrounding the use of such a word well enough for him to know what it means. After reading the 'hole passage, the reader may realize that he has understood the important ideas presented without knowing the leaning of every word. If, after reading the entire passage, the reader is still unable to guess the meaning of a word from\u00a0the context, then he should study the structure of the word The word may be a compound word which, when broken into its component parts, can be easily understood.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If after exhausting these approaches. the reader still does not understand the meaning of a word, and if this word is vital to the comprehension of the whole passage, then and only then, should he refer to a dictionary,\n(a) In one sentence state the purpose of a good dictionary\n(b) In two sentences, one for each, state the two disadvantages of constantly referring to a dictionary when reading a passage.\n(c) In three sentences, one for each, summarize the three steps that a reader should take before referring to a dictionary.",
