    "explanation": "Romans 13: 1-4 (RSV):\nLet every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.\u00a02\u00a0Therefore he who resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.\u00a03\u00a0For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of him who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval,\u00a04\u00a0for he is God\u2019s servant for your good.But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain; he is the servant of God to execute his wrath on the wrongdoer.\u00a05\u00a0Therefore one must be subject, not only to avoid God\u2019s wrath but also for the sake of conscience.",
