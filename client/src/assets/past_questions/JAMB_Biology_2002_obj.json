    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Be colour blind.\nSince the boy has the genotype YXn:\n- The Y chromosome indicates that he is male.\n- The Xn allele is the recessive allele for colour blindness.\nAs a male, he only has one X chromosome, and since it carries the Xn allele, he will express the trait of colour blindness. Males are more likely to express X-linked recessive traits, such as colour blindness, because they have only one X chromosome. Females, on the other hand, would need to inherit two copies of the Xn allele (one from each X chromosome) to express colour blindness.\nThe other options are not correct:\nA. The boy will not have normal vision because he has the Xn allele.\nC. The boy will not be totally blind; colour blindness is a specific visual impairment, not total blindness.\nD. The boy cannot be a carrier of colour blindness because he is male and only has one X chromosome. Carriers are typically females who have one Xn allele and one normal allele (XN).",

    "explanation": "The first to evolve is the bony fish which evolved from a jawless fish. The amphibians evolved next after fish. The first amphibians evolved from a lobe-finned fish ancestor about 365 million years ago. They were the first vertebrates to live on land, but they had to return to water to reproduce. For this reason, they had to live near water bodies. They had few characteristics of fish in their early life. The reptiles evolved from the amphibians. They lived completely on land. They laid amniotic eggs and had fertilization. They were the first vertebrates that didn't have to return to water for reproduction. Reptiles developed certain added features such as feathers, hollow bones, and warm bodies. These animals were called birds or Aves. Then mammals.\nNote:Mammals and birds both evolved from reptiles-like ancestors.",
