    "explanation": "Separation of power is the division of powers and functions among the three arms of government - the legislature, executive and judiciary. This is essential to prevent the abuse of power when it is concentrated in the hands of a single authority. In a presidential system, there is a clear separation of power. In a cabinet system, there is still separation of power although, it is not as clear (this is because the legislature and executive arms are fused). However, in a military government, power is concentrated in the hands of the military leader. He has the power to make laws through the promulgation of decrees; to execute the law; as well as to punish law breakers.
