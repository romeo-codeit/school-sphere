    "explanation": "Equimolar solution implies all the aqueous solutions have the same concentration.\nThe pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral.\u00a0Values below 7 indicate acidity, and values above 7 indicate basicity. Among all the aqueous solutions we have in the option, NaOH has the highest value, thus it has the highest pH.\nNaOH is a strong base, meaning it completely dissociates into ions (Na+ and OH-) in water, resulting in a high concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) and a high pH.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "explanation": "Fractional distillation of liquefied air, with Nitrogen\u00a0distilling as a vapor at a lower boiling point of -196\u00b0C while O2 is left as a liquid.\nIn the industrial preparation of nitrogen and oxygen from air, the process of fractional distillation is used. This process separates the components of air based on their boiling points.\nThe boiling points of the main components of air are:\n- Nitrogen (N\\(_2\\)): -195.8\u00b0C\n- Oxygen (O\\(_2\\)): -182.96\u00b0C\nBy cooling air to extremely low temperatures, the components can be separated based on their boiling points, allowing for the production of high-purity nitrogen and oxygen.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
