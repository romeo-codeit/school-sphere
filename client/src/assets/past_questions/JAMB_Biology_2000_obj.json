    "explanation": "Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plants, but it's not available in its most common form, atmospheric nitrogen.\u00a0The nitrogen in the air is inert, so plants and animals can't use it directly.\u00a0To be used by plants, the N\\(_2\\)\u00a0must be transformed through a process callednitrogen fixation. Fixation converts nitrogen in the atmosphere into forms that plants can absorb through their root systems.\u00a0Nitrogen fixation can occur through biological,lightning, or industrial processes.\nPutrefaction is\u00a0the biological process of organic matter breaking down, resulting in a foul smell and taste.It\u00a0can also refer to the decomposition of organic waste, such as solid wastes from leather industries.\nIn biology, combustion can refer to\u00a0the process of organic materials generating heat through bacterial composting.\nNitrogen fixation is the process of converting atmospheric nitrogen N\\(_2\\) into a form that plants can use. Also,nitrificationconverts ammonia\u00a0into nitrates used by plants.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
