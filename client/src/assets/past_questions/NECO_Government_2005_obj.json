Representative assemblies were common at the village and town levels, ensuring that the voices of community members were heard in governance matters. The familial structure served as the foundation of Igbo society, with extended families forming a network of connections that influenced decision-making and social cohesion.\nThe Hausa-Fulani and Kanuri of Northern Nigeria practised Monarchy. The Kano Empire and Sokoto Caliphate were the administrative systems that controlled Northern Nigeria",

    "explanation": "Federalism in Nigeria was adopted due to factors such as:\n1.\u00a0Desire for some form of political unity\u2013 The need to unite the different ethnic groups and regions under one political system while allowing some level of autonomy.\n2. Diversity of the nation\u2013 Nigeria is made up of multiple ethnic groups, languages\u00a0and cultures and this makes\u00a0federalism a suitable system to accommodate these differences.\n3.\u00a0Emergence of tribal nationalism\u2013 Ethnic groups wanted to protect their interests and this led\u00a0to demands for regional autonomy.\n4. Influence of shared colonial experience\u2013 British colonial administration influenced the federal structure, especially with the introduction of regionalism in 1946 under the Richards Constitution.\nHowever,\"Desire for uniform treatment for all parts\"wasnevera factor in adopting federalism. Federalism allows forregional differencesin governance, laws, and policies, rather than enforcing uniformity across all regions. In fact,one key reason for adopting federalism was to allow different regions to develop at their own pacebased on their unique circumstances.",
