In this scene, Laertes storms into the castle in a rage, seeking revenge for the death of his father, Polonius.\nThe phrase\"Save yourself, my lord\"suggests thatthere is a threat to the King(Claudius).The metaphor\"The ocean... Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste than young Laertes\"compares Laertes' rage to a violent ocean wave, indicating that he is approaching forcefully.The King, fearing for his safety, ordersthe doors to be guardedto prevent Laertes from reaching him.",
