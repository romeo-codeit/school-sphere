Some powerful members of the society recruit young people to perpetrate heinous crimes and can escape the long arms of the law. They are the fraudsters, kidnappers, ritual killers, etc. Children who grow up in this kind of environment may see nothing wrong with cult activities that involve maiming and killing of innocent people.\n(iii) Emotional sickness: Children who have emotional sickness tend to be depressed and frustrated with life. In an attempt to express their anger against neglect, they may join cults to unleash terror on the society that\u00a0has caused them emotional distress.\n(iv) Peer group influence: Motivation for joining cults may come from peer group influence.

They hardly show interest in the progress of their children's academic activities. Such parents rarely attend parents' fora and meetings. Educational institutions teach religious studies just for students to pass examinations without emphasising the moral lessons that can be learnt from such topics.
