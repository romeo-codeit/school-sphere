The absence of putting in a good word doesn't necessarily mean all members criticized him.\nB. none of the members said anything favourable about him - This option is correct. It indicates that there was no positive endorsement or support from any board member.\nC. some of the members disliked him - The sentence doesn't specify that some members disliked him; it simply states that no one spoke positively about him.\nD. none of the members spoke kindly to him - While the sentence doesn't explicitly mention speaking kindly, the focus is on the absence of positive remarks or endorsements.\nOption B, \"none of the members said anything favourable about him,\" is the most appropriate interpretation because it shows\u00a0that there was a lack of positive comments or support from any board member.",
