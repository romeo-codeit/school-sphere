    "explanation": "Agama lizards bask in the sun to help them regulate their body temperature, their internal temperature depends on external sources like sunlight. while courtship display may occur after basking, the primary purpose is thermoregulation rather than attracting females for courtship.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "explanation": "Nuptial flight is\u00a0an important phase in the reproduction of\u00a0termites, and some bees. During this flight, pairs of male and female termites isolate themselves from others and fall to the ground. Their wings then break off and each pair goes on its own to form a nest in a suitable spot. mating occurs in the new nest after some time.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
