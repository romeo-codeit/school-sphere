    "explanation": "Calcium sulphate is only slightly soluble in water, meaning that only a small amount of it will dissolve, and the rest will remain as a solid.\u00a0Calcium sulfate in water forms\u00a0a precipitate, not a suspension.\u00a0While calcium sulfate is only slightly soluble in water, it does not form a true suspension where particles are suspended in the liquid.\u00a0Instead, it generally forms a precipitate, which is a solid that separates from the solution and settles at the bottom.\u00a0\u00a0When calcium tetraoxosulphate(VI) dissolves sparingly in water, aprecipitate\u00a0is formed.\nColloids and precipitates are both related to the separation of substances in a mixture, but they differ in particle size and the process that leads to their formation.\u00a0Colloids are mixtures where particles are dispersed throughout another substance, but don't settle out quickly.\u00a0Precipitates, on the other hand, are solid substances that form and separate from a solution during a chemical reaction.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

The test involves reacting the compound with ammoniacal cuprous chloride to see if a red precipitate forms.\u00a0If a red precipitate forms, the compound is an alkyne and contains at least one triple bond.\u00a0If no precipitate forms, the compound is an alkene and contains at least one double bond.\nTo confirm the presence of a triple bond, you can usebromine water (Br\u2082)orBaeyer's reagent (alkaline potassium permanganate), both of which react with unsaturated bonds (double or triple) by addition reactions, causing the colour of the reagent to disappear.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
