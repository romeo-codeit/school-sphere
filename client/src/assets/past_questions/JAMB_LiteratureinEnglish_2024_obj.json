Other types of love may prove to be temporary, but true love will stand the test of time. We find this idea in the third stanza of the poem, where the poet's persona states: 'My face in thine eyes,/ thine in mine appears/ And true plain hearts do in the faces rest.\" Their love for each other shows in their eyes.\nFurthermore, the poet's persona refers to himself and his lover as \"two hemispheres\" and claims that \"whatever dies was not mixed equally;/ if two lovers be one, or, thou and I/ Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can die.\" Here, he states that both of them are not only halves of one entity but a complete union of two souls. Their love will never die because their love is not a mere union of bodies; it is a union of souls.
