    "correct_answer": "According to the Muslim understanding, the Qur\u2019an was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad\u00a0\u00a0over 23 years, from the age of 40 to his death at the age of 63. Over those 23 years, he received the revelation from God in a number of ways. Most commonly, it was spoken to him directly by the Angel Gabriel, but at other times it came during his dreams, and on a number of occasions, it even came to him directly from God, and he experienced this as the sound of a heavy bell, after which the words of the revelation were made clear to him.\nThroughout those 23 years, the Prophet\u00a0\u00a0endeavoured to share the revelation with those around him as soon as it came. He did this verbally, as he couldn\u2019t read or write, but he strongly encouraged others around him to write down the revelation, as well as memorise it. This was the basis of how Muslims believe the Qur\u2019an became preserved, not purely through written or oral means, but with both strengthening the other. The companions around him constantly strove to memorise the verses, with many eventually memorising the entire book, and simultaneously wrote these verses on parchment, bone, wood, stone, basically whatever they had around them. Over time at least 65 companions functioned as scribes for the Prophet , who eventually established a school in Madinah dedicated to teaching 900 of his companions to read and write.\nHowever, the dialect of the Quraishi tribe that the Prophet \u00a0spoke in was not the only dialect of the Arabian peninsula, and as the religion was adopted by a growing number of tribes, they began to struggle with understanding the Qur\u2019an. To overcome this, the Prophet \u00a0was given permission to teach the Qur\u2019an in 7 of the main dialects in the region, allowing the message to be understood more widely. These dialects didn\u2019t affect the written records, as they were only different when the Qur\u2019an was actually vocalised.\nThis was the state of the Qur\u2019an at the death of the Prophet . Hundreds of companions who had memorised the complete Qur\u2019an in 7 official dialects, all of which were considered valid ways of reciting the Qur\u2019an, as well as an incredible amount of written records that were held by the Prophets companions throughout Madinah and beyond. The placing of each verse within each chapter had been established by the Prophet , but because each chapter functions as an independent unit, the companions had different ways of ordering the chapters themselves within the book as a whole.",

    "correct_answer": "The month of Zhul Hijja is a special month. It is the month of Hajj. Just as the last ten nights of Ramadan are the best nights of the year, so are the first ten days of Zhul Hijjah. In fact, they are the best ten days of the year filled with immense blessings. One should increase his/her acts of worship (ibadat) through fasting, charity, zikr, additional prayers, supplications, and of course,udhiyahor animal sacrifice, a tradition commemorating the legacy of Ibrahim (AS) for his willingness to sacrifice his son Ismael. This occasion occurs on the tenth day of Zhul Hijjah.In the tenth year after migration to al-Madinah (hijirah), Muhammad (SAW) performed his only hajj along with thousands of companions. The journey of hajj was indeed a significant event. The Prophet (SAW) established the rites of Hajj, an important mode of worship incumbent upon every able Muslim once in his/her lifetime. Additionally, according to some scholars, it is believed that on the ninth day, the day of Arafat, he (SAW) received the last revelation,\u201cThis day, I have perfected for you your religion (deen), completed my favor upon you and am pleased with Islam as your deen (way of life).\u201d(al-Ma\u2019idah, 5:3)The companions rejoiced. However, upon hearing the ayah, Omar (RAA) cried. The Prophet (SAW) asked, \u201cWhat makes you cry O\u2019 Omar?\u201d \u201cAlthough nothing is perfect, our deen is perfect now and I fear that with time it is going to deteriorate,\u201d Omar replied. The Prophet (SAW) agreed and said, \u201cYou have spoken the truth.\u201d He (SAW) then said, \u201cIslam began as something strange, and shall return to being strange as it began, so blessed are the strangers.\u201dIndeed, the samejahilipractices that were prevalent before Islam such as tribal wars, bloodshed, intoxication, music, adultery and fornication, interest and usury, etc. can be seen today everywhere in the world and just as Islam was conceived to be strange back then, the same teachings today are considered to be strange. Therefore, blessed are strangers who adhere to the deen dearly while sharing its message with others.Throughout the journey of hajj, the Prophet (SAW) would admonish and advise his people. His speeches were collected in what is commonly known as \u201cThe Prophet\u2019s Farewell Sermon\u201d orHajjatul Wada\u2019.The sermon highlighted the most significant teachings of his prophetic mission of twenty-three years. Such pearls of wisdom have been etched in the books and minds of many Muslims for all time to come. It was, among others things, a document of human rights.After praising and thanking Allah (SWT), the Prophet (SAW) said, \u201cO people! Lend me an attentive ear. For I know not whether after this year I shall ever be among you. Therefore, listen to what I am saying very carefully and take these words to those who are not present here today.\u201d Months after he delivered the sermon, the Prophet (SAW) returned back to His Lord leaving behind a great legacy.The Prophet\u2019s speech began with a word of caution. He addressed the sanctity of human lives. He (SAW) reminds, \u201cO people! Just as you regard this month, this day, this city as sacred so regard the life and property of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will meet your Lord and that He will indeed reckon your deeds.\u201dThe Prophet (SAW) took advantage of the most blessed and sacred day of Arafat in the sacred month of Hajj, in the most sacred place in the world, Makkah to make a point. Bloodshed is forbidden due to the sanctity of human life. In addition to human life, people\u2019s properties are also sacred. In a hadith the prophet insisted, \u201cThe blood, wealth and honor of the Muslim are sacred to all Muslims.\u201d He (SAW) stressed, \u201cThe destruction of the world in the sight of Allah is lighter than the killing of one Muslim man.\u201dThe Qur\u2019an is very clear on this subject as many passages address the sanctity of human lives. In one place Allah emphatically stresses this point,\u201cAnd do not take any human being\u2019s life \u2013 (the life) which God has willed to be sacred \u2013 except through (due process of) law.\u201d(17:33) The Qur\u2019an clearly states that whoever kills an innocent soul has committed an act akin to murdering all of humanity.\u201cIf anyone kills a person; unless in retribution for murder or spreading corruption in the land, it is as if he kills all mankind, while if any saves a life it is as if he saves the lives of all mankind\u201d (al-Ma\u2019idah,5:32).The US declaration of \u201cWar on Terrorism\u201d has left millions dead. The imperial wars succeeded in dividing Muslims creating a rift between Muslim nation states sowing the seed of discord and disunity. Muslims killing other Muslims, complete destruction of cities and towns, people leaving their homes and properties to be plundered and looted by gangs that allege to be good Muslims - apparently the teachings of the Prophet (SAW) have fallen on deaf ears.In addition to the sanctity of human lives, the Prophet mentioned the sanctity of properties, \u201cReturn the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners.\u201d This statement echoes Allah\u2019s mandate,\u201cAllah commands you to return the trusts to their rightful owners.\u201d(an-Nisa\u2019,\u00a04:58) One of the main qualities of a true believer is that they safeguard their trusts and fulfill their promises.Muslims who have betrayed any trust, big or small, to any person, Muslim or non-Muslim, must settle it before meeting his/her Lord. Those who don\u2019t will have a difficult time on the Day of Judgment as such matters will be settled by Allah (SWT) on the grand day of accountability,\u201cAnd He is the Best of Judges.\u201d(al-An\u2019am,\u00a06:57) The Prophet (SAW) made it very clear, \u201cHurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will meet your Lord and that He will indeed reckon your deeds.\u201dIn his sermon, the Prophet (SAW) touched upon something of great importance, the subject of interest and usury (riba). Riba was introduced in Arabia by the Jews who lived there. The practice ofribais so abhorrent that even the polytheists (mushriks) of Quraish would not accept a penny earned from interest when rebuilding the Ka\u2019bah. Originally the Ka\u2019bah extended to the extremities of Hijr of Ismail (semi-circle). However, due to shortage of funds, they built the Ka\u2019bah into the cube as it is known today. The polytheists of Makkah recognized the filth ofribaand knew very well its negative implications and how such a practice could invite the wrath of God.The Prophet (SAW) in his farewell sermon cautioned, \u201cAllah has forbidden you to take usury (interest). Therefore, all interest obligations shall henceforth be waived. Your capital is yours to keep. You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity. Allah has judged that there shall be noribaand that all interest due to Abbass Bin Abdul Muttalib be waived.\u201dThe entire world economic system is based on interest (riba). This practice strengthens some countries and weakens others. It makes the rich richer and the poor poorer, thus widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots. This is purely contrary to the teachings of Islam. Fair distribution of wealth based on fair dealing and equity is the spirit of Islamic economics. The main principal clause in the Islamic economic system is \u201cSo that it (wealth) does not circulate between the rich among you.\u201d (al-Hashr, 59:7)",

This doesn\u2019t mean just saying it, rather it means saying it with full meaning, therefore fulfilling its conditionsThe conditions of of \u201cla ilaaha illa Allah\u201d are:Knowledge in what you are saying. [Muhammad:19]Certainty in what you are saying. [Al-Hujurat:15]Sincerity in your worship. [Al-Zumar:2]Truthfulness in what you are saying. [Al-Zumar:54]Love for what you are saying and what it entails. [Al-Baqarah:165]Submission to what it entails. [Al-Nisaa\u2019:125]Acceptance in everything that it entails. [Al-Ahzab-36]The conditions of \u201cMuhammad Rasoolu Allah\u201d are:Affirming his message and believing in it inwardly within the heart. [Al-Hujurat:15]Uttering the testimony and affirming it outwardly upon the tongue. [Al-Hujurat:15]Following him by acting upon whatever he has come with from the truth and abandoning whatever he has prohibited from falsehood. [\u2018Aal-Imran:31]Attesting to whatever he has informed of from enjoining the good and prohibiting the evil and the unseen affairs of the past and in the future and other than that. [Al-Hashr:7]Love for him must be more intense than love for oneself, wealth, father, son and all of the people. (The prophet (sallaAllahu \u2018alayhi wasallam) said, \u201cNone of you truly believes until I am more beloved to them than their father, children, and all of mankind\u201d [Reported in Bukhari & Muslim])Putting his statement over the rest of the people, regardless of whoever they might be, and to act upon his Sunnah. [Al-Hujurat:1]To magnify, honour, respect, exalt, and revere him. And to magnify, honour respect, exalt, and revere what he came with from Allah, and that is the Book and the purified Sunnah. And that cannot occur, except by acting upon the two of them and loving them more than one loves himself. [Al-Fat-h:8,9]The testimony is an example of how the previous prophets (alayhim assalam) used to give da\u2019wa, which is by negating all that is incorrect and then affirming what is correct. This can be seen as the testimony starts off with a negation \u201cNone worthy of worship\u201d, which is followed by an affirmation \u201cexcept Allah\u201dA major deviation of the real purpose of the testimony is to say that everything is in the heart and actions are not neededAnother major deviation is to concern ourselves with purification of the heart and ignoring everything else\nThe hadith says \u201cestablishing the prayer\u201d, which is different to just \u201cpraying\u201dIn the Qur\u2019an Allah refers to the believers as those who establish the prayer, but when He speaks about the ones who don\u2019t pray properly, or don\u2019t pray on time, He just refers to them as \u201cthe ones who pray\u201d e.g. {Woe unto the ones who pray} [Al-Maa\u2019oon, 107:4]Definitions of \u201cestablishing the prayer\u201d:Praying with the heart, soul, with awe and with khushoo\u2019Bowing and prostrating, reciting of a complete manner, with full concentration and fear of AllahPrayer is the best of deedsThe effects of prayer on a person keeps him away from evilIbn Al-Qayyim said prayer is of five degrees:The one who is careless and is therefore punishedThe one who prays on time but at the same time he is distracted and is therefore admonishedThe one who fulfils his prayer by fighting the devil and is therefore redeemedThe one who is entirely concerned with his prayer and is therefore rewardedThe one who performs his prayer while only being preoccupied with Allah and is therefore rewarded and brought closer to AllahAbandoning the prayer takes someone out of the fold of this religionThe Messenger of Allah (sallaAllahu \u2018alayhi wasallam) was talking about obligatory prayers and he said, \u201cwhoever abandons it purposely, then bari\u2019at minhu al dhimma(Islam is free from him)\u201d (ibn Majah)The Messenger of Allah (sallaAllahu \u2018alayhi wasallam) said:\u00a0 \u201cThe covenant that distinguishes between us and them is the prayer, and whoever neglects it has disbelieved(become a kaafir).\u201d (Ahmad)However, The Messenger of Allah (sallaAllahu \u2018alayhi wasallam) also said: \u201cWhoever says la ilaaha illa Allah will enter jannah\u201d (ibn hibban)The above hadith seems to contradict the two hadiths mentioned before it, as the implied meaning of the hadith is that saying \u201cla ilaaha illa Allah\u201d is sufficient to admit someone into JannahTo understand the topic better, and remove the conflict, Scholars say:Shahada is the key to jannah, and every key has its teeth. The teeth for it were mentioned in the commentary of the first part of the hadith, and they included \u201cSubmission to what it entails\u201d, therefore praying falls under this conditionWe give preference for the explicit evidences over the implicit ones. The above hadith implies that prayer is not required to admit someone into Jannah, but the two hadiths before it explicitly say that it is required, so we understand it in light of the two hadiths before it, which is that prayer is actually requiredThe majority opinion is that if someone generally stops praying then he becomes a kaafir, but if he prays on and off then he is not a kaafir, but has committed a grave sinPrayer is composed of pledges, commitments, and recognitions which we make in every prayer. A great short piece of work was written on this topic.

    "explanation": "Brief Commentary:\nThe correct translation of Islam is \u201csubmission\u201d, and it is incorrect to translate it as \u201cpeace\u201dA building is built on pillars, and if the pillars are not there, then the building will collapse, therefore if these pillars of Islam are not there then a person\u2019s Islam will collapseWe are required to say the testimony in this lifetime, and believing in it without having ever said it is not sufficientIt is incorrect to translate \u201cla ilaaha illa Allah\u201d to be \u201cThere is no god but Allah\u201d because Allah mentions in the Qur\u2019an that there are other gods, and He also spoke about the one who takes his desire to be his god, therefore we don\u2019t say there is no god but Allah because there are other gods but they are not real gods that deserve worship.The correct translation of \u201cla ilaaha illa Allah\u201d is \u201cThere is no deity worthy of worship except Allah\u201dVirtues of \u201cla ilaaha illa Allah\u201d:It is a price tag for the gardens of paradiseHe whose last words are la ilaaha illa Allah will enter paradiseIt is a salvation from the hellfireIt necessitates being forgivenIt is the best of all good actionsIt wipes away sinsIt renews the eeman that is planted in the heartIt outweighs on the scales the records of sinsIt traverses all barriers until it reaches Allah, the MajesticIt is the best of what all the prophets have saidIt is the best form of remembranceIt is a protection from the shaytaanIt is a means of safety from the darkness of the grave and the terror of the gatheringIt will be a distinguishing sign for the believers when they emerge from their gravesTo know it is the best blessing that Allah has blessed us withThe prophet (sallaAllahu \u2018alayhi wasallam) said, \u201cWhoever says la ilaaha illa Allah will enter Jannah\u201d (Reported in ibn Hibban). This doesn\u2019t mean just saying it, rather it means saying it with full meaning, therefore fulfilling its conditionsThe conditions of of \u201cla ilaaha illa Allah\u201d are:Knowledge in what you are saying. [Muhammad:19]Certainty in what you are saying. [Al-Hujurat:15]Sincerity in your worship. [Al-Zumar:2]Truthfulness in what you are saying. [Al-Zumar:54]Love for what you are saying and what it entails. [Al-Baqarah:165]Submission to what it entails. [Al-Nisaa\u2019:125]Acceptance in everything that it entails. [Al-Ahzab-36]The conditions of \u201cMuhammad Rasoolu Allah\u201d are:Affirming his message and believing in it inwardly within the heart. [Al-Hujurat:15]Uttering the testimony and affirming it outwardly upon the tongue. [Al-Hujurat:15]Following him by acting upon whatever he has come with from the truth and abandoning whatever he has prohibited from falsehood. [\u2018Aal-Imran:31]Attesting to whatever he has informed of from enjoining the good and prohibiting the evil and the unseen affairs of the past and in the future and other than that. [Al-Hashr:7]Love for him must be more intense than love for oneself, wealth, father, son and all of the people. (The prophet (sallaAllahu \u2018alayhi wasallam) said, \u201cNone of you truly believes until I am more beloved to them than their father, children, and all of mankind\u201d [Reported in Bukhari & Muslim])Putting his statement over the rest of the people, regardless of whoever they might be, and to act upon his Sunnah. [Al-Hujurat:1]To magnify, honour, respect, exalt, and revere him. And to magnify, honour respect, exalt, and revere what he came with from Allah, and that is the Book and the purified Sunnah. And that cannot occur, except by acting upon the two of them and loving them more than one loves himself. [Al-Fat-h:8,9]The testimony is an example of how the previous prophets (alayhim assalam) used to give da\u2019wa, which is by negating all that is incorrect and then affirming what is correct. This can be seen as the testimony starts off with a negation \u201cNone worthy of worship\u201d, which is followed by an affirmation \u201cexcept Allah\u201dA major deviation of the real purpose of the testimony is to say that everything is in the heart and actions are not neededAnother major deviation is to concern ourselves with purification of the heart and ignoring everything else\nThe hadith says \u201cestablishing the prayer\u201d, which is different to just \u201cpraying\u201dIn the Qur\u2019an Allah refers to the believers as those who establish the prayer, but when He speaks about the ones who don\u2019t pray properly, or don\u2019t pray on time, He just refers to them as \u201cthe ones who pray\u201d e.g. {Woe unto the ones who pray} [Al-Maa\u2019oon, 107:4]Definitions of \u201cestablishing the prayer\u201d:Praying with the heart, soul, with awe and with khushoo\u2019Bowing and prostrating, reciting of a complete manner, with full concentration and fear of AllahPrayer is the best of deedsThe effects of prayer on a person keeps him away from evilIbn Al-Qayyim said prayer is of five degrees:The one who is careless and is therefore punishedThe one who prays on time but at the same time he is distracted and is therefore admonishedThe one who fulfils his prayer by fighting the devil and is therefore redeemedThe one who is entirely concerned with his prayer and is therefore rewardedThe one who performs his prayer while only being preoccupied with Allah and is therefore rewarded and brought closer to AllahAbandoning the prayer takes someone out of the fold of this religionThe Messenger of Allah (sallaAllahu \u2018alayhi wasallam) was talking about obligatory prayers and he said, \u201cwhoever abandons it purposely, then bari\u2019at minhu al dhimma(Islam is free from him)\u201d (ibn Majah)The Messenger of Allah (sallaAllahu \u2018alayhi wasallam) said:\u00a0 \u201cThe covenant that distinguishes between us and them is the prayer, and whoever neglects it has disbelieved(become a kaafir).\u201d (Ahmad)However, The Messenger of Allah (sallaAllahu \u2018alayhi wasallam) also said: \u201cWhoever says la ilaaha illa Allah will enter jannah\u201d (ibn hibban)The above hadith seems to contradict the two hadiths mentioned before it, as the implied meaning of the hadith is that saying \u201cla ilaaha illa Allah\u201d is sufficient to admit someone into JannahTo understand the topic better, and remove the conflict, Scholars say:Shahada is the key to jannah, and every key has its teeth. The teeth for it were mentioned in the commentary of the first part of the hadith, and they included \u201cSubmission to what it entails\u201d, therefore praying falls under this conditionWe give preference for the explicit evidences over the implicit ones. The above hadith implies that prayer is not required to admit someone into Jannah, but the two hadiths before it explicitly say that it is required, so we understand it in light of the two hadiths before it, which is that prayer is actually requiredThe majority opinion is that if someone generally stops praying then he becomes a kaafir, but if he prays on and off then he is not a kaafir, but has committed a grave sinPrayer is composed of pledges, commitments, and recognitions which we make in every prayer.

    "correct_answer": "1. THE FIRST CATEGORY OF VALID EXEMPTION: ILLNESS\nIllness is any condition that takes a person outside the bounds of health as the result of some indisposition. Ibn Qudamah (d. 1223ce) said: \u201cThere is consensus among the scholars regarding the permissibility of breaking the fast due to illness in general, as stated in the verse of the Quran:\u00a0Yet if one among you is sick or is on a journey, [such a person shall then fast] the same number of other days\u00a0(Surat Al-Baqarah, 2:185).\nThe Companion (of the Prophet, on him be peace) Salamah ibn Al-Akwa\u2018 reported:\nWhen the verse\u201cwa \u2018ala\u2019l-ladh\u00eena u\u00fbthiqunahu\u2026\u201d/\u201cYet for those who are hardly able to endure it\u2026\u201d\u00a0(Surat Al-Baqarah, 2:184) was revealed, those who wanted to break their fast were allowed to break their fast and pay the redemption, until the verse \u201cShahru Ramadan alladhi\u2026\u201d\u2019 /\u00a0\u201cIt was the month of Ramadan in which\u2026\u201d\u00a0(S\u00fbrat Al-Baqarah, 2:185) was revealed and abrogated the one before it.\nSo, the prescription to fast went through stages. First, God permitted the believers to break their fast. Then God obligated the fast unless one had a valid justification for not doing so.\nIllness remained a valid reason for not fasting, though not any illness or pain legitimately excuses one from fasting. If one fears that fasting will worsen the sickness, delay its cure, or cause damage to anything in the body, then one has a valid excuse for breaking the fast. In fact, oneshouldbreak one\u2019s fast under these circumstances, for the higher obligation is to keep oneself from becoming debilitated or, of course, from perishing.\nIf one is well, but feels the difficulty of fasting, this does not rise to the level of sufficient cause for breaking the fast. The exception here is the Hanafi legal school\u2019s position that if one who is well believes itvery likelythe fast will cause him or her to fall ill, one can break the fast. If, however, the fear of illness is anxiety or apprehension of illness, more delusion or obsession than actuality, then it is not permissible to break fast.\nThe Malikis disagree with the Hanafis in this, holding that if the healthy person has no illness to begin with but merely harbors a fear that fasting will cause illness, then he or she is barred from breaking the fast because the fear of illness neither proves the likelihood of such an outcome, nor does it meet the standard of a sufficient legal proof authorizing action. If, however, one knows with great certainty that fasting will definitely cause real harm, he or she can break the fast. The distinction, then, is diagnosing the likely onset of real harm as a result of fasting as opposed to a difficulty caused by fasting, as difficulty in fasting is a wholly invalid justification.\nNow, even though one who is ill ought to break the fast, it does not render his or her fast invalid if one chooses to complete the fast.\nTHE SECOND CATEGORY OF VALID EXEMPTION: TRAVEL\nA. Travel defined and delimited\nThe kind of travel that allows one to break one\u2019s fast must fulfill at least three conditions, and a fourth, according to all but the Hanafi juristic school:\n1. DISTANCE:Enough for one to shorten the ritual prayer (about 50 miles, according to most scholars, but the norm, which is the better measure, is what is considered by people of the time and place a journey).\n2. DURATION:The person in the state of travel or far from home does not have the intention of staying at that destination for more than three days. In this latter case, the person may be permitted to not fast during the travel (if they fulfill the requirements of distance, exceedance, and intentionality), but must resume the fast when they arrive at their destination of more than three days.\n3. EXCEEDANCE:One must go beyond the limits of the city or town one is staying in. This means if one were to travel 50 miles but still be within his metropolitan or town area, it would not count as travel. The question of whether one\u2019s metropolitan area remains as one\u2019s town or home region should be taken seriously, such as Greater Chicago, for instance.\n4aINTENTIONALITY:According to the majority of scholars, the person undertaking the journey must not be making it for unlawful reasons or to unlawful destinations, like a gambling trip to Las Vegas. This is because the allowance to break one\u2019s fast is to make travel easy. If someone is undertaking an unlawful action, they are not included in the principle of creating ease for the traveler.\nTHE THIRD CATEGORY OF VALID EXEMPTION: AGE\nThere is consensus that it is permissible for the elderly not to fast. There is no specific definition for old age. It pertains to what people know and agree to be an age that is very advanced and disabling.\nTHE FOURTH CATEGORY OF VALID EXEMPTION: THIRST AND HUNGER\nSevere thirst and grave hunger are both valid reasons not to fast, but not just any kind of acute thirst or hunger. If one really believes that the continuation of their fast will physically harm them because they are suffering from severe thirst or hunger, then it is permissible for them to break fast. If one in the military anticipates engagement and breaks the fast because of this likelihood, but engagement does not occur, there is no penalty for having broken the fast.\nTHE FIFTH CATEGORY OF VALID EXEMPTION: COERCION\nIf a faster\u2019s well-being is threatened, such as it being said to a faster: \u201cIf you do not break your fast, you will be punished or confined,\u201d there is no penalty if one breaks the fast under such duress.

If one really believes that the continuation of their fast will physically harm them because they are suffering from severe thirst or hunger, then it is permissible for them to break fast. If one in the military anticipates engagement and breaks the fast because of this likelihood, but engagement does not occur, there is no penalty for having broken the fast.\nTHE FIFTH CATEGORY OF VALID EXEMPTION: COERCION\nIf a faster\u2019s well-being is threatened, such as it being said to a faster: \u201cIf you do not break your fast, you will be punished or confined,\u201d there is no penalty if one breaks the fast under such duress. Yet one remains obliged to make up this missed fast.",

    "correct_answer": "Despite Muslim community perceptions that under Islamic laws women can only divorce with their husband\u2019s consent or by means of community processes, there are in factmultipleoptions available by which Muslim women in Australia can secure a religious divorce. Derived from the primary religious texts of the Qur\u2019an andSunnah(sayings and teachings of Prophet Muhammad) and formulated by Muslim male jurists into religious rulings by the twelfth century (six centuries after the introduction of Islam), they have become codified in many contemporary Muslim countries through case law or legislation.\nMen can initiate divorce throughtalaq\u2014 which is no-fault \u2014 and they do not need the wife\u2019s consent. According to Muslim jurists, this form of divorce is extra-judicial, in that they do not need to declare it before a religious authority. In order to manage registration of marriages and divorces, however, most Muslim countries now require men divorcing throughtalaqto notify the court.\nWomen are able to initiate divorce through the process ofkhul\u2018.This is a form of no-fault divorce referred to in the Qur\u2019an andSunnahwhere the husband\u2019s consent was not stated to be required. In these primary texts, the wife is granted the ability to divorce her husband for the simple reason ofincompatibility, and there are records of women at the time of the Prophet who married and divorced numerous times. There are also reports of women who married the Prophet but then changed their mind on the wedding night and he granted them divorce without seeking cause.\nOver time, however, the majority of Muslim male jurists determined that the husband\u2019s consent was necessary, and most Muslim countries today still adopt these twelfth-century rulings. Interestingly, case law in Pakistan (1967) and legislation in Egypt (2000) returned to the Prophetic practice whereby the husband\u2019s consent was not needed.\nIf the husband is at fault, women can also initiate a judicial divorce throughfaskh,tafriqorta\u2018liq\u2014 whereby in Muslim countries they present their case and prove certain grounds before a court judge. Because this form of divorce does not require the husband\u2019s consent, this is usually the main option women take when they are not successful withkhul\u2018. Given there are no such courts in Australia, Muslim women seek out divorce through community processes involving imams.\nMany imams or religious leaders in Australia prefer the husband to pronouncetalaqor give their consent to akhul\u2018, so that they are not responsible for ending the marriage, but in extreme cases of domestic violence they will award women this form of divorce. However, as reported by the ABC in aseries of investigations across various religious communities in 2018, a number of Muslim women experiencing domestic violence faced numerous challenges seeking religious divorce from imams. This was in part due to imams having narrow interpretations as to what constituted \u201cdomestic violence\u201d and requiring meetings with both the husband and wife present in the same place.\nIn my research, as well asthat of others, imams and community leaders are becoming aware of the dangers presented to women experiencing domestic violence and are working with specialist services to make the religious divorce a safer process for women.\nAnother option for divorce is that women can specify in their marriage contract her right to divorce throughtalaq at-tafwid, whereby the husband grants his right oftalaqto his wife through delegation so that she can initiate divorce without needing his consent. Contrary to common belief among many Muslims, he still maintains his right oftalaq. Given the sensitive nature of mentioning divorce at the time of marriage, many Muslim women are discouraged by their families from including it in their contract for fear that they are seen as not committing to the marriage long-term.
