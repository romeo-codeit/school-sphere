    "explanation": "The passage primarily focuses on the description of rainfall and its consequences during the month of July. Let's analyse why the other options are not correct:\nA. Cloud: While the passage does mention the sky being \"hooded\" and wearing black, the primary emphasis is on the result of the cloud's behaviour, which is rainfall. The mention of the sky being ready to shed its load indicates the imminent rainfall.\nB. Climate: The passage is more specific in describing the weather conditions during the month of July, particularly the heavy rainfall. It doesn't delve into a broader discussion of climate patterns or conditions.\nD. Flood: Although the passage mentions a destructive blessing and the loss of life's savings, it doesn't explicitly state that a flood occurred. The emphasis is on the heavy rainfall and its impact on the town, not necessarily on a flood.\nIn summary, while elements like clouds, climate, and some consequences (like a destructive blessing) are mentioned, the main subject is the heavy rainfall during the month of July and this is confined with the use of the word \"downpour\"",
