However, Gamaliel, a respected Pharisee and a member of the Sanhedrin, advised caution.\nGamaliel's point was that if the apostles' actions were merely human endeavours, they would eventually come to nothing. However, if their movement was from God, then opposing it would be futile, as it would be a direct opposition to God's work. Gamaliel's advice led to the release of the apostles, and the early Christian community continued to grow and spread its message.",
