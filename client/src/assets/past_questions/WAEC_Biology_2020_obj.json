    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Reasons why termites are most active during the night:\nAvoiding Predators:By coming out at night, termites try to avoid their predators like birds, ants, and other insects, who might feed on them during the day. So, this is their self-defense mechanism.\nNesting Behavior:Termites feel more secure during the night. They prefer building new colonies in the ground or inside the woods at night. They feel more secure traveling between their food sources and nests without worrying about being noticed.\nFeeding Patterns:Another reason for termites to come out at night is their feeding pattern. These silent destroyers feed on paper, wood, and other organic matter. They prefer emerging out at night in search of food without any disturbance, which is more common and frequent during the daytime.\nColony Organization:Termites usually organize their colonies in different sections like soldiers, workers, and reproductives. Worker termites being more responsible as well as sensitive to the daytime environments,\u00a0 prefer carrying out their responsibilities during the darkness of night.\nConserving Moisture:Termites can easily dry out and look for ways to conserve moisture to survive. This is not possible during the daytime when the temperature is high, so they come out at night when the air is cooler and humidity levels are higher so that they can conserve moisture for survival.",
