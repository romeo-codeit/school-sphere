    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The term\"chanson\"is derived from the French word for \"song\" and historically refers to a type of French art song that was prominent during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. These songs were often preserved in manuscript collections known as chansonniers.\nIn theMiddle Ages, chansons were primarily monophonic, meaning they consisted of a single melodic line. They were popularised by thetrouv\u00e8resandtroubadours, who were poet-musicians composing songs about themes like courtly love. Over time, these chansons evolved into more complex forms, incorporating polyphony (multiple independent melodies sung simultaneously) during the Renaissance.\nThe subject matter of chansons often revolved around themes of love, chivalry\u00a0and other courtly ideals. They were performed in sophisticated styles, catering to audiences with refined artistic tastes, such as those in royal courts.",
