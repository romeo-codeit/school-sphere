The angel told them to go quickly and tell the disciples that he had arisen and was going to Galilee where they would meet him.\nxi. Matthew did not say that the angel appeared to the women but only to the guards.\nxii. According to Mark, when the women entered the tomb, they saw a young man sitting at the right side, in a white robe and when they went in, they did not find the body of Jesus; thus, they were perplexed.\nxiii. The women then saw the vision of the angel who gave them information regarding the resurrection of Christ.\nxiv. They were asked to inform the disciples. Mark made emphasis to Peter.\nxv. The women left quickly from the tomb with awe and ran to tell the disciples that Jesus had arisen.\nxvi. But before then, Jesus had appeared to them, saluting them, 'Hail' as they took hold of his feet and worshipped him.\n(B) ROLES OF WOMEN IN THE CHURCH TODAY\ni.

    "correct_answer": "(A) JAMES' ARGUMENT ON FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD (JAMES 1:22-27; 2:14-26)\ni. James advised Christians to live according to the word of the Lord which they had heard.\nii. He said it would be no use to hear the word and fail to put it into practice.\niii. According to James, if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like someone who sees himself in a mirror and turns away and immediately forgets himself.\niv. James points out that he who observes the perfect law of liberty and perseveres in it by acting and not only being a hearer would be blessed in his doing.\nv. According to James, God's blessing comes through works and not faith.\nvi. James was of the opinion that if one thinks he is religious but does not bridle his tongue, he deceives his heart and his religion is vain.\nvii. He held the view that practical and unidentified religion before God entails the visitation of orphans and widows in their affliction.\nviii. And also keeping oneself unstained from the world.\nix. James said it is of no use to say you have faith but have no works to demonstrate the faith you have.\nx. He taught that faith must be combined with practical works to produce the desired results.\nxi. According to James, if someone was poorly clothed and hungry and you asked him to go in peace and be filled without providing the clothes and food for them, you are not backing your faith with works.\nxii. Hence, faith without works is dead and useless.\nxiii. He asserted that it is not enough to believe in God.\nxiv. Belief in the only true. God is good, for even the devil also believes in God, but does not do the will of Him. Hence, faith in God without works is unacceptable.\nxv. James cited two Old Testament figures who exhibited faith and works in unison. For example, Abraham justified his faith by works when he was prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac.\nxvi. According to James, faith is justified by works; hence, Abraham believed in God and it was counted to him as righteousness and he was called a friend of God because he acted on his faith.\nxvii. A person is therefore justified by works and not by faith alone.\nxviii. Similarly, Rahab, the prostitute justified her faith by works when she received the messengers of Joshua and sent them out by another way.\nxix. James concluded by saying that as the body without the spirit is dead so also faith without works is dead.\nxx. Faith should manifest itself in the love of God and service to humankind and not the mere expression of it by words alone.\n(B) BENEFITS OF FAITH TO A CHRISTIAN\ni. Faith helps Christians to believe and trust God/have fellowship with Him.\nii. It enables Christians to be committed to God/depend and rely on Him.\niii. It assures Christians of eternal salvation.\niv. It shows that Christians are not under law but under grace.\nv. It is by faith that Christians face life's challenges with courage and strength, e.g. persecution.\nvi. Faith motivates Christians to do good works in all fields, e.g. Education, Medicare, Evangelism, caring for the poor and the needy.\nvii.

For a while, Elijah was afraid to meet King Ahab for fear that Jezebel might kill him because she had earlier persecuted the prophets of Yahweh.\n17. But after a while, the Lord told Elijah to present himself to King Ahab.\n18. Ahab accused Elijah of being the troubler of Israel.\n19. But Elijah maintained that it was Ahab and his royal house that had brought the drought because of their worship of Baal.\n20. However, the tension was resolved by the contest on Mount Carmel, requested by Elijah.\n21. The supremacy of God was established after Elijah won the contest.\n22. Elijah then had the Baal prophets killed to reflect his victory over the Baal prophets.\n(B) Steps that can be taken to minimize religious tensions in society.\n1. Tolerance/respect for the views of other religions/ avoid partiality/show love for all religions.\n2. Have understanding and concern for others/ avoid derogatory remarks.\n3. There should be inter-religious dialogue.\n4. The state should recognize all religious faiths/freedom of worship.\n5. Desist from greed and covetousness.\n6. Do not tolerate evil counsel.\n7. Focus on God only/fear God.\n8. Sinners must be condemned.\n9. Counselling people who go astray.\n10. Men of God should speak against injustice/corruption, etc.\n11. Using social media to expose evil deeds and doers in society.\n12. Rights of citizens should be respected.",
