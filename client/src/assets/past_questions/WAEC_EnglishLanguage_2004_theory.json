However, I can't be a good medical doctor because as you know, I'm soft-minded, and cannot stand the sight of blood. Besides, I believe I can fare better in engineering. I'm making this explanation, because I can see that you want me to choose medicine as a course to study at the university.\nI prefer to study mechanical engineering. First and foremost, I want you to know that mechanical engineers are not many in this country, and this is the reason our society needs them. On the other hand. medical doctors are many which makes medicine not to be as lucrative as mechanical engineering.\nIn Nigeria today, mechanical engineers are a hot cake because the government is planning to build more vehicle assembly plants to add to the existing ones. This policy thrust comes out of the need to have a Nigerian car. Definitely, after graduating as a mechanical engineer, I won't find it difficult to get a job. I also know that you wouldn't want me to come out of the university only to roam the streets in search of employment. That is why as a mechanical engineer, there will be jobs waiting for me.\nIn addition to this, I would prefer to study a course that I have aptitude for. I want you to remember that even as a small boy. I constructed toy cars and trucks automated with batteries. I remember that Mr. Ndu, your intimate friend then, always encouraged you to make sure that I become an engineer because of the potential he saw in me. Why are you now insisting that I must study medicine at the university?\nYou should allow me choose the course that I like. Parents, nowadays, don't choose courses for their children. It is old-fashioned and unacceptable, because from experience children, whose parents choose courses for, don't become successful in the long run. The fact is that such children never do well in life and they often go back to blame their parents for their failure.\nFinally, you are aware of the hatred that I have for hospitals.

    "correct_answer": "THE BENEFITS THAT WILL BE DERIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENT SHOWING INTEREST IN AGRICULTURE\nAgriculture is one of the means by which the government of any country that is serious about feeding its populace and raking in foreign exchange can use to improve the living standard of its people as well as generate revenue. Nigeria can improve her economy by showing interest in agriculture. Unfortunately, the government of Nigeria is yet to show serious commitment in the area of agriculture which would have been a major source of revenue.\nObviously. there is a lot to benefit, if the government can show interest in agriculture. First, the major benefit of agriculture to the people of the country is the availability of cheap and quality food for all. If the government develops interest in agriculture, there would be adequate production of food in large quantities. Then, there will be food for all and sundry thereby solving the problem of malnutrition and acute poverty. As a result of this step, many Nigerians would have enough food on their tables and they would be healthy as well.\nAnother benefit to be derived from the government showing interest in agriculture is that there will be huge amount of money generated as revenue from the sales of the agricultural produce within the country and even through exportation. Exportation of excess agricultural produce will bring huge foreign exchange earning into the country, which the government could use to provide infrastructural facilities in the country.\nFurthermore, agricultural sector being the type that requires a large labour-force can also help to create employment for the large number of unemployed able-bodied men and women in the country. This can solve the problem of unemployment facing the country today. Since agriculture provides cheap food and employment, then the menace of crime in our society will be reduced to the barest minimum. When the government does everything necessary to boost agricultural production, there will be abundant food for people to eat, there will be employment and money will be in the pockets of the people to spend.\nAgriculture can also help improve the other sectors of the Nigerian economy. The agro-allied industries will have enough raw materials to carry out their production processes. This will go a long way to developing the economy. Finally, the country's dependence on crude oil will be drastically reduced, if the government can show interest in agriculture. Crude oil will no longer become the major source of government income and the violence that is the order of the day in our oil producing areas from time to time will be drastically reduced.\nNnadozie Chukwuka\nSS3C",

    "correct_answer": "HEALTH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN WEALTHGood day, Mr. Chairman, Panel of Judges, Ladies and Gentlemen. I am standing before you to oppose the motion which states that wealth is more important than health. I would rather say that health is more important than wealth. Being healthy refers to a state of physical and psychological well-being of an individual, devoid of sickness, while being wealthy refers to opulence, affluence or a state of being rich. It is better to be healthy than to be rich with one ailment or the other, because of the following reasons.First and foremost, there is a wise saying which states that \"Health is wealth.\" There is no adage that is truer than this. Health is indeed wealth because anybody that is healthy has everything. He has the freedom and the agility to go about his business to earn a living. His hope of getting money, which is what wealth is all about, is sustained by his health. On the other hand, an unhealthy person is tied down to his sick bed. He would not be able to go about his business as he is being restrained by the sickness in his body. A visit to our various hospitals will confirm to you that if your have health you have everything.In addition to this, while wealth can be acquired, health cannot be acquired just as you acquire money. Good health is maintained and sustained by good and simple hygienic living. It is also a gift from God, which to some extent nobody can claim he has worked for. Health is not about what you can say in terms of being smart or the ability to cut corners in order to get it as you could do to get wealth.Furthermore, health is a major prerequisite to making money. It is an important factor necessary to make wealth. If a person desires to make wealth and he has no health, he is incapacitated. However, a healthy man has the ability to make wealth because his healthy body can supply the energy he needs to put into his business for wealth creation. It always gets to a point in the life of an unhealthy rich man when he would wish that all his money should go so that he could be healthy. This shows how important good health is in the life of a person.Mr. Chairman and my audience, is it not because you are healthy that you are here? Can somebody that is sick or ill be in our midst? Obviously no, because such person will either be in an hospital or his sick bed in his house. Whereas health is wealth, wealth is not health.

He had always pictured Lagos as a wonderland of bright lights, paved roads, elegant people riding by in their expensive cars, and beautiful residential quarters. This invitation was the wonderful opportunity for him to leave his small village for the first time and experience first-hand the good life of the city that he had imagined so much about!\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The fateful day came and Eze, happy as a lark, bid an excited good-bye to his family. The first leg of his trip started modestly in the back of the rickety lorry that plied the dirt road linking his village to the rest of the world, but Eze was sure that he would later ride triumphantly into Lagos on one of those legendary luxury buses that he admired so much. This was also an experience to look forward to! \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 When he arrived in Lagos, it was almost dark. The first things that struck him as he alighted from the bus were the teeming crowd with their desperate unsmiling faces, the deafening noise of the ceaseless traffic, the polluted air with its acrid smell of exhaust fumes and decay, the endless rows of dirty and crumbling concrete buildings, and the filth everywhere. What a sharp contrast with the city he had built up in his imagination! But surely there must still be much to look forward to. Back in the village, Uncle Chike was regarded as a well-to-do trader. So Eze was further surprised and disappointed to find that he lived in a single room in a sleazy part of the city. At night, it got hot and stuffy, but they dared not open the windows as this would bring an invasion \u00a0of mosquitoes.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Eze woke up the next morning feeling clammy, but he could still not have a bath. As his uncle took him to a shack across the street for a hurried \u00a0breakfast of thin tea and mouldy bread, he explained that they usually bought water from a mobile tanker that had not come for some time. Eze was still recovering from his surprise at this information when they rushed off for his uncle s market stall, and he had his first unpleasant ride in one of the notorious molue buses of the city.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As they struggled down from the bus, shoving against the solid mass of desperate, bad-tempered commuters, Eze thought of his village, and the city suddenly lost whatever was left of its attraction \u00a0for him. True, the village was small; life there was monotonous, and it lacked some essential amenities_ But it was peaceful; you drank clean water and ate what you wanted fresh; you moved about freely and breathed clean air; and everyone was friendly and helpful. Greatly\u00a0disillusioned with the city, Eze longed to return to his beloved village!\u00a0\n(a) State two experiences that Eze looked forward to.\u00a0\n(b) Mention any two features of the city that Eze noticed at once\u00a0\n(c) What two discoveries surprised and disappointed Eze when he arrived in the city?\u00a0\n(d) Mention any two experiences in the city that Eze found unpleasant.\u00a0\n(e) What conclusion did Eze draw from his experiences in. the city?\u00a0\n(f) \" as a lark ...\" What figure of speech is contained in this expression?\u00a0\n(g) \"When he arrived. in Lagos,...\" (i) What grammatical name is given to this expression as it is used in the passage?\u00a0\n(ii) What is its function? .\u00a0\n(h) For each of the following words, find another word or phrase which means the same and which can replace it as it is used in the passage.

    "text": "Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It is no longer news that the social and economic problems of African countries continue to worsen. What we experience daily \u00a0are the vicious consequences of unemployment, inadequate health and educational facilities, urban squalor resulting from a population bursting at the seams \u00a0and, most frightening of all, the rate at which crime is rising It is also no longer news that many Africans now see ''checking out\" of their countries for other supposedly better ones abroad as the only solution to the problems. In this regard, the United State, Britain, Canada, Germany and Italy are the hot favourites. Most of these Africans are usually so desperate to leave that they fall easy prey to all sorts of passport and visa fraud, and often end up smuggling themselves abroad at all costs. In such countries, they have to do all manner of menial jobs, sometimes resorting to criminal activities, and are often cut off completely from families and relations back home. Young girls who have been enticed \u00a0with assurances of a rosy future often end up in forced prostitution, with all its unpleasant consequences!\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Is \"checking out\". the ideal solution to Africa's social and economic problems? Of course not! What is baffling is why Africans cannot see abandoning their countries as a step that holds out \u00a0no solution at all. All that they achieve, in fact, is the substitution of one set of problems for another!\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 What then should we do? We must look inwards for a more realistic solution. First, we must develop the will to tackle our problems. Where there is a will, it is said, there is a way. If we abandon our problems instead of tackling them on, we will simply be leaving an unpleasant legacy for future generations. Secondly, we must orient ourselves tows res self-reliance and self-employment, instead of looking helplessly to our embattled government for salaried employment,\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Finally, we must seek a long-term solution by addressing the population question. It is obvious that Africa's outsize population is at the root of the problems. The question we should ask ourselves is. if the average family size in America or Britain were to be as large as the average African family, would these countries still be as attractive to us as they are now? The big puzzle is that we have adopted the white man's lifestyle in all other respects, but have made an exception of family size.\u00a0\n(a) Mention two sequences of the usual desperation of Africans to leave their countries.\u00a0\n(b) The writer argues that escaping abroad is not the ideal solution to Africa's problems. Quote one sentence from the passage that sums up the writer's recommended solution.\u00a0\n(c)According to the writer, why should Africans solve their problems rather than avoid them?\u00a0\n(d) What does the writer consider the most serious cause of African's problems?\u00a0\n(e) What does the writer imply by using the word \"supposedly\" in the second paragraph?\u00a0\n(f) \"What we experience daily . \" (i) What grammatical name is given to this expression as it is used in the passage?\u00a0\n(ii) What is its function?\u00a0\n(g) \" a population bursting at the seams \" What figure of speech is contained in this expression?\u00a0\n(h) For each of the following words or phrases. find another word or phrase which means the same and which can replace it as it is used in the passage. (i) prey' (ii) enticed: (iii) ideal; (iv) holds out; (v) tackle: (vi) head-on.",

    "text": "Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For some, grass is just the green stuff outside the house that they have to mow. For farmers and football players, it is indispensable. For children it is the ideal playground. And those who live in most urban areas assume they have very little to do with grass of any sort. However, almost all of us have daily contact with some type of grass and the product made from it.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Grass makes up a major part of the vegetation that covers the earth And no wonder, since it is one of the most adaptable plant groups on earth, growing in polar regions and deserts in tropical rain forests, and on wind-swept mountain slopes. Entire vegetation areas are dominated by grass.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Unlike many other plants, grass grows, not at the tip but in growth areas above the nodes. New shoots might start from stems growing horizontally on or under the ground. So when the lawn mower or the cow cuts away the tip, or fire rages through a field. grass keeps growing whereas many other plants stop Furthermore. with most grasses, if the - stem is bent over by the wind or trodden underfoot, it can raise itself erect by growing faster on the side facing the ground. For these reasons, grass usually recovers quickly after being damaged. which gives it an edge over other plants in the fight for sunlight.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Grass is not only the most abundant but also the most important flowering plant family on earth. A botanist once described grass as the foundation of our food it is \"like a dam protecting mankind from famine.\" Try to remember what you ate today. Did you start with a bowl of cereal made with millet. rice, oats, or sorghum? Well, then, you ate grass seeds. Or perhaps you had a roll or other kind of bread. The flour used was made from grass kernels - wheat, rye, barley, and other grains are all grasses Cornflakes and other corn products are no exception. as corn or maize is a grass too. You had sugar in your tea or coffee? More than half of all sugar is made from sugarcane, a grass.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Grass is not only good for food, however. If your house has walls made of clay and straw, it is grass that gives them the necessary strength. In different parts of the world. roofs are thatched with grass. One of the advantages of such roofs is that they keep the interior of the buildings cool regardless of the external temperature.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Grass covers and adorns much of the earth. Apart from the beautiful, peaceful, and relaxing sight of a green meadow or a well-kept lawn, grass is a major oxygen supplier, because of the sheer mass of the green vegetation that it produces.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Finally, its fine roots perform the all-important function of protecting the soil from erosion. Keeping its versatility in\u00a0mind we are not surprised to learn that the usage and cultivation of grass has a long history. The next time you see a waving cornfield, a lush green meadow, or just humble blades of grass growing between stones in a sidewalk, you might stop and think of this marvelous and most versatile plant family!\u00a0\n(a) In two sentences, one for each, summarize the two reasons why grass forms a major part of the earth's vegetation.\u00a0\n(b) In four sentences, one for each, summarize the four ways in which grass is useful to humans.",
