Ammoniacal liquor;- production of fertilizer\n(d)i) calcium hydrogen trioxocarbonate (IV): -calcium tetraoxosulphate (Vi): - magnesium tetraoxosulphate (Vi)\n- magnesium hydrogen trioxocarbonate (IV); - iron (III) chloride.\n(ii)heating the water to boiling / distillation: addition of calculated amount of calcium hydroxide: - addition of washing soda crystals: - ion exchange resin permutit\n(iii)- calcium ions in the water are good for method children's teeth and bones: it helps to reduce heart diseases; does not dissolve lead pipes: - tastes better than soft water:- provides calcium salts used in manufacturing of food in plants: production of exoskeleton of animals / shells Tannery:",
