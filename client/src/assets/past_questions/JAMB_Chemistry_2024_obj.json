According to this law, under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, the rate of diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass.\n\\(\\frac{R_x}{R_y}\\) = \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{M_y}{M_x}}\\)\nFrom the question, Gas X diffuses twice as fast as gas Y\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 i.e\u00a0 x = 2y\nThis implies x =2 while y = 1\nFrom\u00a0\\(\\frac{R_x}{R_y}\\) = \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{M_y}{M_x}}\\)\n\\(\\frac{2}{1}\\) = \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{M_y}{M_x}}\\)\n\\(\\frac{4}{1}\\) = \\(\\frac{M_y}{M_x}\\)\nM\\(_y\\) = 4 M\\(_x\\)\n\u21d2 Gas Y is 4 times as heavy as Gas X. - OptionB\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "explanation": "In anelectrolytic refining\u00a0process, theanode is made of impure metal, and thecathode is made of a strip of pure metal.When an electric current is passed through the electrolyte,metal ions from the electrolyte are deposited as a pure metal on the cathode.A soluble silver salt is used as an electrolyte in the electrolysis of silver metal because\u00a0it allows for the deposition of a pure metal on the cathode.\nIn the electrolysis of silver metal,\u00a0you cannot use any rod at the anode;\u00a0it is crucial to use a silver rod as the anode because the process relies on the oxidation of silver ions from the silver anode into the solution to deposit pure silver at the cathode;\u00a0using a different metal would not produce the desired result.\u00a0\u00a0The net result is that silver metal has been transferred from the anode to the cathode.\nIn summary, a silver rod is used at the anode, the spoon has to be cathode since we must obtain a pure silver spoon while the electrolyte must be a soluble silver salt\u00a0because it allows easy deposition of metal ions as a pure metal on the cathode.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Strong and weak acids can be distinguished by their\u00a0pH value, electrical conductivity, and reactivity.\nA conductivity measurement can distinguish between strong and weak acids as strong acids have a higher concentration of H+ and ionize completely in water, resulting in a higher concentration of ions and greater electrical conductivity.\u00a0Weak acids only partially ionize, resulting in fewer ions and lower electrical conductivity.\nGenerally, all acids turn blue litmus red.\nStrong\u00a0acids have lower pH values than weak acids.\u00a0The pH scale measures the concentration of H+ in a solution, and the more H+ present, the closer the pH is to 0. Thus, measurement of pH can be used to distinguish between strong and weak acids.\nThe measurement of heat of reaction can distinguish between strong and weak acids.Strong acids\u00a0have a higher enthalpy of neutralization than weak acids.\u00a0This is because strong acids completely ionize in water, releasing all of their protons (H+ ions),\u00a0while weak acids have a lower enthalpy of neutralization than strong acids.\u00a0This is because weak acids only partially ionize, releasing a small fraction of their protons.\nConsequently, since the use of litmus paper can't tell us how strong a solution is, option B is the correct answer.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

The chemical composition of water remains the same when it boils.\u00a0The chemical formula for water is H\\(_2\\)O, and it remains the same whether the water is a liquid, gas, or solid.\nWhen sodium reacts with oxygen in the air, it breaks bonds in the sodium and oxygen molecules and forms new bonds in sodium oxide and sodium peroxide.\u00a0This process is called oxidation, which is a chemical reaction. This reaction is similar to calcium metal dissolved in water.\nAlso, when kerosene is burnt, you can't recover it anymore, hence it is not easily reversible.

In a condensation reaction, two molecules combine to form a larger molecule and a small molecule, such as water, is released. Esterification, the reaction between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid to form an ester, fits this definition as it produces water as a byproduct.Neutralization reactions, on the other hand, involve the reaction between an acid and a base, producing salt and water, and are not a direct analogy for esterification.
