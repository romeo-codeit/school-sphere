    "correct_answer": "The play criticises the gender roles assigned to women in the traditional society. In Senehun and Mendeland at large, women are not treated as equals of men. Women are considered fragile, vulnerable and incapable of managing crises. From the beginning of the play, Chief Gbanya tries to relegate Madam Yoko's duties to dancing and satisfying him in bed, and not to interfere in state affairs. To Chief Gbanya such responsibility is meant for men alone. Chief Gbanya shares the same sentiment with his Chief Warrior Ndapi who beats and pounds on his wife \u2013 Jilo, at any slightest opportunity. He beats Jilo for not always serving him his food at the right time, being lazy and not looking after their daughter. Initially, Gbanya has promised Yoko she would be his successor. However, with troubles around, he feels reluctant to handover the throne to her because he believes women cannot handle a land at war. This is the same stance of Lamboi. The excuse he gives for wanting to kill Gbanya is because he does not want the latter to appoint Yoko as his successor. However, the women protest in different ways. Jilo protests by having an affair with Lansana who takes her as a human being by showers her love, admires her good looks, qualities and praises her alluring waist which is in contrast to Ndapi who rarely appreciates her food, beauty and skills in bed. Obviously, if not for Yoko's doggedness and insistence, a woman would not have become the chief of Mendeland; talk more of expanding the chiefdom.In Mendeland, women usually are not allowed into the Poro cult. Yoko is the only exception. In the village, there is a certain prejudice held against women. They are considered inferior and except for Yoko who forges ahead, women are not assigned ruling positions.",

    "correct_answer": "One of the primary conflicts of the play pits traditional Yoruba customs against a western conception of progress and modernity, as represented by the conflict between Baroka and Lakunle for Sidi's hand in marriage.Lakunle represents the modern Nigerian man. He wears western clothing, has been educated in a presumably British school, and wants to turn his village into a modern paradise like the city of Lagos. Lakunle doesn't just admire and idolize western society; he actively and loudly despises the traditional customs of his village and the people who support them. This is best illustrated by Lakunle's refusal to pay Sidi's bride price.For much of the play, other characters describe Baroka as being directly opposed to modernity and extremely concerned with preserving his village's traditional way of life. Lakunle, in particular, finds Baroka's lifestyle abhorrent. He describes how Baroka paid off a surveyor to not route train tracks through the outskirts of Ilujinle, thereby robbing the village of a link to the modern world that would modernize the village. However, when Baroka himself speaks, it becomes apparent that he doesn't actually hate modernity or progress. While he obviously delights in the joys and customs of village life, when it comes to modernity he simply hates having it forced upon him. He sees more value in bringing modern customs to the village on his own terms. For example, he argues that creating a postal system for the village will begin to bring it into the modern world without entirely upending the village's way of life.The competition between Baroka and Lakunle for Sidi's hand in marriage brings the conflict between tradition and modernity to life. Baroka wishes to add Sidi to his harem of wives, while Lakunle dreams of having one wife who, in theory at least, is his equal. Both men promise Sidi a different version of power and fulfillment. When Baroka dies, Sidi will become the head wife of the new Bale, a position that would make her one of the most powerful women in the village. Lakunle, on the other hand, offers Sidi the possibility of an equal partnership in which she's not required to serve her husband as is traditional. The presence of Lakunle represents the British Colonial Government forcing their culture on Nigeria's traditional belief system which downgrades the personality of Africa as primitive and barabaric. Lakunle, in his show of modern romance kisses Sidi and she describes that as unclean and he never denies that yet calls Sidi's dressing and mannerism as barbaric.",

    "correct_answer": "\"The Leader and the Led\" by Professor Niyi Osundare is an allegorical poem that avers the kind of leadership in Africa and what leadership ought to be. The poem establishes the cat and mice relationship that exists between African leaders and their followers.The poet's African origin and the siting of the tropics as the meeting place of the animals unmistakably point Africa as the point of reference in the poem. The poet no doubt addresses the eyesore of leadership deficiency Africa as a continent is plagued with. Osundare first addresses the issues of bad leadership, leadership ineptitude, and gross misgovernance which have become the rallying cries for many short-changed African followers. The poet, as he does, examines the kind of relationship that exists between African leaders and their followers. He then typifies the type of leadership peculiar to African countries since their purported independence from European colonialists.The poet uses the attributes, bodily features and predatory ability of some of the contending animals as proofs of the leadership inadequacies Africa is beset with. In \"the lion\" and \"the hyena\", Osundare shows African leaders as exploiters and oppressors. With their powers, they exploit Africa and its citizenry of resources and oppress the people they are supposed to lead. This makes them ideal replacements of their equally exploiting colonial masters. In the the typical ways of \"the lion\" and \"the hyena\", these leaders endanger the lives of those whom they have sworn to protect. In \"the lion\", the poet uses \"the ferocious pounce of his paws\" on antelopes as an analogy of the deliberate and calculated oppression of the citizenry by the machinery of the state. The poet also portrays the elitism of African leaders typified by the farness of the giraffe's eyes from the ground. African leaders are only close to the people before assuming power or when they are seeking for votes into elective posts. Once they assume power, they distance themselves from the masses. In \"the zebra\", the poet references the dubiousness and deceptiveness of African leaders. Using \"the duplicity of his stripes\" as a focal point, the poet posits that African leaders can not be trusted to do anything right or taken for what they say or on the face value because behind their sugar-coated lies are several ulterior motives. Like \"the pack\" of animals, the people are justifiably suspicious of their leaders' \"duplicity\".No doubt, Niyi Osundare's \"The Leader and the Led\" has done justice in its depiction of the type of leadership in Africa. The poem figuratively describes African leaders as \"ferocious\", \"lethal\" in appetite, duplicitous, greedy, \"riotous\" and \"trampling\". The poem, however, offers insights on what ideal leadership is. It says ideal leadership embodies transparency, compassion, humility, legitimacy, the will to govern, the readiness to listen to the followers, and a balance between ideas on the opposite sides of the fringe.",

    "correct_answer": "The subject matter of the poem circles around the nature and completeness of the lovers' world. Donne takes the everyday idea that lovers are engulfed in a world of their own; thus, they are oblivious to reality as it appears as though the outside world is not real. The intensity of their love is sufficient to create its own reality. The poem depicts love as a feeling that surpasses other feelings and one that thrives against odds.In typical Donne's fashion, the poem takes the reader right into the bedroom which is the crucible of passion and thought.In this poem, Donne employs a dramatic and ecstatic tone. He begins on a note of restraining excitement in the expression of the feeling of love shared between himself and his lover. He marginalizes their feelings and places them above all and against odds. He compares their love to two hemispheres of the world and theirs is perfect. This, thus, evokes a romantic mood through the poem.",

    "correct_answer": "\"Journey of the Magi\", is one of the four Ariel Poems written by Eliot during 1927 and 1930. It is in the form of a monologue in which a magus, one of the Three Wise Men who came from the East to Bethlehem to see the infant Jesus, narrates their journey long after the event, and analyses its impact on their imagination. It was written by Eliot soon after his conversion to Catholicism. The agony of parting with one faith and embracing another is therefore the theme of the poem. In order to express this feeling, Eliot, according to his poetic practice, chooses the biblical alibi of the journey of the three Wise Men f rom the East to Bethlehem to see the Incarnation. Eliot believes that \"poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality' So to escape from his emotion of agony and his personality, he dissolves himself in the emotion and personality of the Magi placed in a similar situation.The poem is in the form of a monologue. One of the Magi, long after their journey, narrates the event in the end he analyses with uneasiness the impact of the journey on their imagination. He accepts the birth of the new faith. But he does not understand its significance. He is also unwilling to relinguish his pagan way of life which Christ has come to destroy. His \"hard and bitter agony is as painful as that of the poet who is enchained to the past and unable to submit to a transition.The Magi began journey during the worst time of the year. It was the very dead of winter. The journey was long and the ways were deep and hard. The camels on which they travelled were galled, sore-footed and refractory. They often lay down in the melting snow. The Wise Men felt sorry for leaving their summer palaces and the silken girls bringing sherbet. The camel men cursed complained and ran far away for want of liquor and women. They had no nightfires or shelter. The cities were hostile and the towns unfriendly. The villages were dirty and changed his sprices. At last they decided to travel by night sleeping only in snatches. All along, their voice of reason was reminding them that their action was foolish. The last part of the poem is more blatantly the Magus reminiscing about the story (\"all this was a long time ago, I remember\"), and in his recollection, he seems to be doubtful about whether or not the birth was a good or bad, replacing as it would his own religion and culture. In fact, at the end of the poem, he seems to regard it as a bad thing indeed, with the Magus wishing for his own death alongside the death of his peoples' conventional beliefs; hence, regret.",
