    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Vibrissae.\nGiant African rats, like many other rodents, use their vibrissae (whiskers) to navigate in the dark. Their vibrissae are highly sensitive to touch and can detect even slight changes in air pressure, helping them to:\n1. Detect obstacles and avoid collisions\n2. Sense the width of tunnels and passages\n3. Locate food and other objects. In underground habitats, where visibility is limited, the vibrissae become a crucial sensory organ for navigation.\nThe other options are less relevant:\nB. Nostrils: While important for smell, they're not directly useful for navigation.\nC. Eyes: Limited visibility underground makes eyes less useful.\nD. Tails: While helpful for balance, tails aren't directly involved in navigation\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

Consequently, one of the adaptations shown by hydrophytes in freshwater is\u00a0poor development of roots and xylem tissues. Two common adaptations are:\n1. Poor development of roots: Since water is readily available, hydrophytes don't need extensive root systems to absorb water and nutrients.\n2. Poor development of xylem tissues: Xylem tissues are responsible for transporting water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. With abundant water surrounding the plant, the need for xylem tissues is reduced.\nThe other options are not accurate:\nA.

Here, the blood is filtered, and urea, a waste product, passes through the glomerular filter into the nephron.\n2.Bowman's capsule: The filtered blood, including urea, collects in the Bowman's capsule, a cup-like structure surrounding the glomerulus.\n3.Convoluted tubules(proximal): From the Bowman's capsule, the filtrate (including urea) flows into the convoluted tubules. Here, some reabsorption and secretion occur, helping to regulate the amount of urea in the urine.\n4.Henle's loop: The filtrate then passes through Henle's loop, a U-shaped structure that helps concentrate the urine. Water and electrolytes are reabsorbed, increasing the concentration of urea.\n5.Convoluted tubules (Distal):The concentrated urea then enters the distal convoluted tubule, where further reabsorption occurs.\n6.Collecting tubules: Finally, the concentrated urine, containing urea, flows into the collecting tubules. Here, the final adjustments to the urine are made, and it is transported to the renal pelvis, then to the bladder, and eventually excreted.\nThe other options are incorrect and do not accurately reflect the sequence of urine formation.",

This coloration pattern is an example of countershading, which helps to:\n- Reduce visibility by breaking up the outline of the body\n- Create a sense of volume and depth, making it harder for predators to detect the rat's shape and movement. Countershading is a type of protective coloration that helps animals blend in with their surroundings and avoid detection.\nThe other options are not the best fit:\nA. Disruptive colouration involves bold, contrasting patterns that break up an animal's outline, making it harder to see.

    "explanation": "Amplexus defines the mating position of frogs and toads, in which the male clasps the female about the back.\nAmplexus is a type of mating behavior exhibited by some externally fertilizing species in which a male grasps a female with his front legs as part of the mating process, and at the same time or with some time delay, he fertilizes the eggs as they are released\u00a0from\u00a0the female's body.\n\"Mating\" refers to the general act of sexual reproduction between two organisms, while \"amplexus\" is a specific mating posture used by frogs where the male clasps onto the female's back, aligning their cloacae to facilitate external fertilization;\u00a0essentially, amplexus is a type of mating behavior unique to frogs, focused on positioning for egg fertilization, rather than the broader term of mating itself.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "explanation": "Charles Darwin was one of the first to scientifically document that roots showpositive gravitropismand stems shownegative gravitropism. That is, roots grow in the direction of gravitational pull (i.e., downward) and stems grow in the opposite direction (i.e., upwards).\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "explanation": "Abscisic acid (ABA) is found in the\u00a0roots and leaves\u00a0of plants, including seedlings.\u00a0ABA is a plant hormone that helps plants respond to environmental stress and developmental processes.\nAscorbic acid, also known as vitamin C, is found in\u00a0all cell compartments of plants, including the cell wall, chloroplasts, and cytosol.\nEthylene is found in\u00a0all parts of a plant, including seedlings.\nAuxin alters the plant wall plasticity making it easier for the plant to grow upwards.\u00a0Auxin\u00a0is a plant hormone found in the roots of seedlings.\u00a0Auxin is produced in the tips of the roots and shoots, and it can diffuse to other parts of the plant.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
