    "explanation": "In the sentence \"The principal has gone to Freetown and will come back in two weeks' time,\" the apostrophe should be used after \"weeks\" as \"weeks' time.\" The use of the apostrophe in \"weeks' time\" indicates possession or ownership. This construction is a common and idiomatic way to express a duration of time in English. It's used to specify when something will happen or for how long.\nThe apostrophe is placed after \"weeks\" because it is a plural noun. When forming the possessive form of a plural noun that ends with an \"s,\" we typically add only an apostrophe after the \"s\" (e.g., \"the students' books,\" \"two weeks' time\").",
