The Quranic fragments were then used to prepare a complete master copy of the Quran during the Caliphate of Uthman ibn Affan. Zayd ibn Thabit was instructed to compile a master copy of the Quran from all the loose material. Muhammad (pbuh) had read the Quran in a certain order which was memorised by many people during his life. Zayd requested every companion of the Prophet (pbuh) to bring him their written verses of the Quran. He only accepted written material which had been dictated by the Prophet (pbuh) himself.",

A Quranic tafsir attempts to provide elucidation, explanation, interpretation, context or commentary for clear understanding and conviction of God's will.Principally, a tafsir deals with the issues of linguistics , jurisprudence , and theology . In terms of perspective and approach, tafsir can be broadly divided into two categories, namely tafsir bi-al-ma'thur (received tafsir), which is transmitted from the early days of Islam through the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions , and tafsir bi-al-ra'y (lit. tafsir by opinion), which is arrived through personal reflection or independent rational thinking.",

    "explanation": "Qur'an 2:42 SaysAnd do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it].For the proper understanding of this verse we need to recall that in the time of the Prophet the Jews of Arabia were more learned than the Arabs. In fact, there were some Jewish scholars of Arabia whose fame had spread even beyond the confines of that land. It was natural in such circumstances that, when the Prophet began to preach his message, the ignorant Arabs should approach the Jews and ask their opinion of the Prophet and his teachings, particularly as the Jews also believed in Prophets and Scriptures. We find that this inquiry was often made by the Makkans, and continued to he addressed to the Jews after the Prophet arrived in Madina.In reply to this query, however, the Jewish religious scholars never told the candid truth. It was impossible for them to say that the doctrine of monotheism preached by Muhammad was incorrect, that there was any error in his teachings regarding the Prophets, the Divine Scriptures, the angels and the Next Life and that there was any error in the principles of moral conduct which the Prophet propounded. At the same time, however, they were not prepared to make a straightforward affirmation of the truth of his teachings. In short, they neither categorically denied the Truth nor were prepared to accept it with open hearts.Instead, they tried to plant insidious doubts in the minds of everybody who enquired about the Prophet and his mission.\nIt is this attitude of the Jews to which the Qur'an alludes when it asks them not to overlay the truth with falsehood.",
