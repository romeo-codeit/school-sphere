    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "An advantage of bus topology over star topology is that \"it requires less cable length than star topology.\"In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single central cable (the bus), which means that less cabling is required compared to a star topology where each device has its own cable running to a central hub or switch. This can result in cost savings in terms of both cable material and installation.It's important to note that while bus topology has its advantages, it also has drawbacks, such as potential issues with signal degradation and difficulty in identifying and isolating faults. Each topology has its own set of strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on factors like the network's size, layout, and specific requirements.",

    "explanation": "An input device that converts an image into text is known as an \"optical character reader\" (OCR).OCR technology is used to recognize printed or handwritten characters in an image and convert them into editable and searchable text. It is commonly used to digitize printed documents, such as books, articles, invoices, and receipts, making it easier to store, search, and process the text electronically. OCR technology is widely used in various applications, including document scanning, data entry, text recognition, and document management systems.Scanners and barcode readers are also input devices, but they do not convert images into text. Scanners convert images into digital images, while barcode readers convert barcodes into numbers. Optical mark readers (OMRs) are used to read marks made on a document, such as those made by a pencil or pen.",

It indirectly affects data transfer speed by allowing more efficient access to memory locations.Clock Speed: The clock speed of the CPU determines how many instructions the CPU can execute per second. A higher clock speed generally leads to faster data processing.Data Bus Width: The width of the data bus affects the amount of data that can be transferred between the CPU and memory in a single bus cycle. A wider data bus can transfer more data at once.However, \"broadband status\" is not typically a factor that directly affects the speed of data transfer within a computer system.

The - 1 operator subtracts one from the result of the today() function. Therefore, the expression =today() - 1 will return the date that is one day before the current date.In this case, the current date is 02/02/2008. Subtracting one from this date gives us 02/01/2008.NB:By default, Excel uses the mm/dd/yyyy format for dates. This means that the month is represented by the first two digits, the day is represented by the third digit, and the year is represented by the last four digits. The date format in Excel can be customized to suit your needs.However, you can change the date format to something else if you prefer.
