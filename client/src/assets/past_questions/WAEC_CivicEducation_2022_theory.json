    "correct_answer": "(a) Human rights are commonly understood as being those rights which are inherent in the mere fact of being human. Human rights are universal and inalienable; indivisible; interdependent and interrelated.\nThey are universal because everyone is born with and possesses the same rights, regardless of where they live, their gender or race, or their religious, cultural or ethnic background. Inalienable because people's rights can never be taken away.\nIndivisible and interdependent because all rights \u2013 political, civil, social, cultural and economic,\u00a0are equal in importance and none can be fully enjoyed without the others. They apply to all equally, and all have the right to participate in decisions that affect their lives. They are upheld by the rule of law and strengthened through legitimate claims for duty-bearers to be accountable to international standards.\n(b).\u00a0- The police in enforcing law and order can ban public assembly and demonstrations which will deny a citizen his right to freedom of association and assembly.\n- Rights to the freedom of expression and press are restricted by the law preventing individuals from saying or publishing statement that could damage the personality of others (laws of slander and libel).\n- A citizen may be denied his rights to free movement if he is detained on medical ground in order not to spread contagious disease if such citizen is suffering from a contagious disease.\n- Right to private property may be restricted by the right of the state to compulsorily acquire private property for public use.\n(c)\u00a0- Stability/Organization: Citizens' rights are entrenched in the constitution in order to have a well-arranged documentation of the rights of citizens in a country and since the constitution is the body of regulation that guides the affairs of a country, it is the most appropriate to house human rights.\n- Understanding specifics of human rights: Human rights are entrenched in the constitution so that everyone can access them and understand the conditions surrounding these rights as well as their limitations.\n- Rule of Law: The rule of law is a liberty centred constitutional concept which stipulates that everything must be done in accordance with the law. It encapsulates such ideals as government according to the law, equality before the law and the independence, and autonomy of the judiciary among others. This helps to make human rights applicable and efficient.",

Parents can teach children to be comfortable when socializing from an early age.-Encouraging independent thought: In a democratic society, or indeed in any society, good citizenship involves expressing one's opinions, and also respecting the opinions of others. This is seen not least in the voting process. Responsible parenthood, then, also involves teaching children to respect others' opinions \u2013 and to develop their own opinions too.

Thus, part of responsible parenting may well include taking children out to enjoy public parks, theatre productions and so on in the city.-Becoming responsible parents too: Our parenting style will often inspire our children when they become parents in their turn.

Hence training and retraining of drivers constitute a formidable means of effectively dealing with the issue of road traffic accident reduction. In Nigeria today, major road traffic accident scenes have been noticed to involve commercial transporters/vehicles.

    "correct_answer": "(a).\u00a0Political parties are a group of persons organized to acquire and exercise political power. Citizens vote for the party of their choice and, in this way, influence government policy. The presence of the political party is actually a healthy situation for the nation. It gives people a choice to make a more evolved and effective decision. Political parties are essential institutions of democracy. By competing in elections parties offer citizens a choice in governance, and while in opposition they can hold governments accountable.\n(b).\u00a0- In order for citizens to make informed choices at the ballot box, they need accurate information about the candidates and political platforms they're choosing between. This means that governments can't prevent the media from covering opposition candidates or parties, and it also means that parties don't intentionally spread misinformation. So access to reliable information is a key requirement for credibility of democratic elections.- In a democracy with free and fair elections, governments exist for the people, are empowered by the people, and are made up of the people. A citizen who is eligible to vote should also be eligible to run for office. Governments cannot attack or prevent people who want to run for office, assuming they meet the same eligibility criteria as other politicians and candidates.- Even if voters are given the right to vote, and are able to register to vote, an election is not free and fair unless they are then able to actually cast their ballot. Governments need to make voting reasonably possible for citizens. They must not be overly burdened to reach polling places, and reasonable accommodation should be made to ensure that citizens with a disability or other health condition, or lack of transportation, are still able to vote.- Nobody should be intimidated or threatened at any point during an election. This includes outside and inside the polling station, but also before election day. The threat of violence can make people afraid to vote their preference. The threat of violence also does not need to be overt to violate this standard. If the government staffs polling places with poll watchers who are intentionally intimidating looking, or even armed, this can intimidate voters. So too can having people observe the actual process of voting. This is why secret ballots are important to ensure that voters feel safe and secure while voting.-Every eligible voter should be able to cast one ballot, and it should be counted the same as every other ballot. When illegal ballots are counted along with legal ballots, the result does not reflect the will of voters.- Counting all ballots and giving an accurate reporting of that count are essential parts of a free and fair election. Ballots must not be altered or thrown out after they are cast. And when a fair count is done, the government cannot refuse to release it, or release a different result.",

    "correct_answer": "- Bribery and Corruption: The quick, smooth operation of the civil service is often handicapped by bribery and corruption. Some public servants no longer do their official duty, rather they are looking forward to being bribed before doing their duties.- Mode of employment: MOST (not all) employment into the public service is not mainly on merit. Employment is given to those that are highly connected or those that are ready to pay for the employment. Some of these people may not be qualified for the job and these will affect the level of productivity. Sometimes, the unqualified person is appointed or promoted to a position he cannot perform well, while the qualified person is passed over due to favoritism.- Bottleneck in Administrative procedure: The Nigerian Public Service is govern by its constitution (Public Service Rules), employment, retirement and sacking of Civil Servants are done by or with the permission of the Federal Civil Service Commision (FCSC). This means that as an employee, your boss cannot sack you. He can only give you a query or make complains to the FCSC. This makes most workers to misbehave and engage in different misconduct.- Duplication of offices and position: The public service is often criticized for wasting financial and manpower resources, and retaining unproductive workers with the creation of ministries, departments and positions with similar functions.- Ineffective organization: The public service has been touted as being ineffectively organized, and improperly managed. For instance, records, documents, files and other sources of information are not well arranged nor properly coordinated. This may be due to frequent movement of workers or non-delineation of responsibilities.",
