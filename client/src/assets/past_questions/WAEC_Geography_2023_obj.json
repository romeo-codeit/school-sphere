Weathering is the breaking down of rocks, soil and minerals as well as wood and artificial materials through contact with the Earth's atmosphere, water, and biological organisms. Erosion is the process that breaks things down. As far as we're concerned, erosion is the breakdown of the continents and the land around you. The overall effect of breaking down and wearing away is called weathering. Deposition is the geological process in which sediments, soil and rocks are added to a landform or land mass.",
