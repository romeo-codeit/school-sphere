    "correct_answer": "The poet decries the destruction of nature through the felling of trees. He maintains that\u00a0nature has a role to play in the affairs of human beings. To demonstrate this role, he makes use of alliteration, repetition and assonance as stylistic devices. The use of alliteration is defined as the repetition of initial consonants of words. Occurs in lines and across lines:\na. Alliteration of 'k' and I sounds, as in whose airy cages/quelled or quenched in leaves the leaping sun\nb. Alliteration of 's', 'd' and 'w sounds in That dandled a sandaled/shadow that swam or sank;/0n\u00a0meadow and river and wind-wandering, weed-winding bank'.\nc. Also, the alliteration of t and 'k' in Ten or twelve, only ten or twelve/strokes of havoc unselve.'\nd. Effect of use of alliteration includes: most of the sounds alliterated are voiceless or soft sounds.\nUse of Repetition: This use is often combined with alliteration and Occurs in several parts of the poem. Example 'All felled, felled, are all felled etc. Use of Assonance: This is simply the repetition of identical or sometimes, similar vowels in words. Example include The vowel 'e' in 'quelled or quenched, or 'mend' and 'end', delve' or selve etc.",
