    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In the Book of Romans 3-4, Paul discusses the concept of justification by faith. He argues that both Jews and Gentiles can be justified, or declared righteous before God, through faith in Jesus Christ rather than solely by adherence to the Jewish law.\nPaul contends that Abraham, the father of the Jewish nation, was justified by faith before the law was given. In Romans 4:13-16 (New International Version), Paul states:\n\"For the promise to Abraham and his descendants that he would inherit the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith.If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void.For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.\"\nHere, Paul argues that if inheritance (or justification) were based solely on adherence to the law, faith would be rendered meaningless, and the promise would be void. Instead, Paul emphasizes that it is faith in Jesus Christ that brings about justification.",
