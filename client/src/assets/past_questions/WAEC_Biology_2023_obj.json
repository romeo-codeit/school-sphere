    "explanation": "Colour of flower: The colour of flowers in plants typically shows discontinuous variation. Flowers can have specific colors like red, blue, yellow, or white, and individuals within a population will usually exhibit one of these distinct flower colors. There are no intermediate or blending colors between the different categories.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Movement of water from root hairs into cortical cells involves osmosis. When a plant's roots absorb water from the soil, it passes through the root hairs and moves into the cortical cells (which are part of the root's inner layer) through osmosis. This osmotic movement of water helps maintain water balance and nutrient distribution within the plant.",

    "explanation": "Iron deficiency in plants leads to chlorosis, which is the yellowing of leaves. Chlorosis occurs because iron is necessary for the formation of chlorophyll, which is the green pigment in plants that absorbs light energy for use in photosynthesis. Without sufficient iron, the plant cannot produce enough chlorophyll, leading to yellow leaves. Stunted growth is also a symptom of iron deficiency as iron is essential for various metabolic processes including DNA synthesis.",
