    "correct_answer": "The major theme of the play is racial discrimination. The three major characters in the play are all symbols of this discrimination. The blacks do not have freedom of movement and they cannot do any job without obtaining residential and work permit. This prompts Sizwe to remove the passbook that contains the name, address, identification number and work permit of the corpse of Robert Zwelinzima which he finds on the way to Buntu's house. The blacks are discriminated against and their rights and privileges denied them. Blacks who work for Ford Motors for twenty-five years are given only wrist-watches as reward for their meritorious service. Another example of racial discrimination is shown where adult blacks are addressed as \"boy\" by even white children yet they cannot complain.\nStyles encounters a lot of difficulties in getting office accommodation for his photo studio all because he is a black man. Buntu, another victim of racial discrimination, concludes that the only hope for the Blackman is for him to die and\u00a0be buried, since some like Zwelinzima do not even have the benefit of a burial. This is the reason why he persuades Sizwe to use the passbook of Zwelinzima. Sizwe Bansi, like other blacks, is denied employment opportunities in his township. He therefore seeks employ-ment elsewhere, but cannot live and work in Port Elizabeth as a result of the restriction placed on blacks. Blacks are relegated to doing only menial jobs. Racial discrimination places blacks at the extremes of poverty, hardship and death. Quta Jacob lives in unbearable conditions and dies a wretched man.",

    "correct_answer": "Comedy is one of the satirical tools used by Athol Fugard to ridicule the racist regime of Pretoria. Comedy is used . as an antidote to the ruthless system of Apartheid. It is a survival technique in the midst of all the dehumanization, frustration and brutality. One of the sources of the comedy in the play is the mimicry of the actions and speeches of characters. The mimicry is particularly made funny so that we can laugh not only at some of the white characters as they climb down from their pedestal of superiority and exhibit human tendencies of fear and anxiety but at the Blackman himself as he exaggerates this fact in mimicry.\nWe laugh at the way Styles mimics the heavy Afrikaans account of Baas Bradley; we laugh at the way he claps his hand to urge the workers to clean and we laugh at the anxious Baas Bradley painting the safety precautions. We cannot help but laugh at the glee on Styles' face as he mimics himself standing over the crouching Baas Bradley who is painting the safety precautions Styles spells. We are amused at the way Styles poses with his camera in front of an imaginary audience. Even the infectious laughter is funny. We also laugh at the Sizwe - Buntu mimicry. Another source of comedy is the use of invective in the language of Styles. Expressions such as, \"Big - shot cunt from America\", \"this old fool\", \"Ford is a big bastard\", \"bigger fool\", \"grandmother Baas\", \"South African monkeys\", are satirically funny especially given the circumstances in which they are used - to bring out the hatred between the blacks and whites at Ford Motors.\nQuite apart from the use of invective, even the language of the play is funny. Styles' description of the war with cockroaches strikes us as particularly ludicrous. The personification of the cockroaches, their recalcitrant behaviour and defiant remonstrances are all funny. Sizwe's explanation of how he was apprehended, the matter-of-fact way that Buntu talks to goad Sizwe out of ignorance bring out the humour with which these serious issues are treated. The character portrayal of Styles, Buntu and Sizwe is also very comical. When Sizwe comes on stage he is. wearing \"an ill-fitting new double-breasted suit\". Styles at Ford's Motors talks of wearing a size 42 overall when his actual size is 38. In their attempt to portray the unpleasant aspects of apartheid the characters strike us as humorous and ludicrous. Also, the exchange between Sizwe and Buntu after their drinking spree, adds to the comedy",

    "correct_answer": "Irony abounds in the play. In the first place, James, who regards non professional jobs as being not lucrative, ends up taking a liberal approach to duties and services. He is shocked to hear that Awere, a mere painter, wins a huge sum of money and international recognition. It is ironical that Bonu, a lawyer who is supposed to uphold the moral standard of the society is himself caught breaching the moral law. For example, when he is entrusted with the career upbringing of a close friend's daughter, he ends up attempting to seduce her while still maintaining a cordial relationship with her father and the entire family.\nAlso, it is ironical that lawyer Bonu, who goes to the house of his friend, James to seduce Maanan thinking that her father is away, ends up being found out by James who is actually in the house and listening to all that is happening between him and Maanan. Dancing as a profession which has been looked down upon by James now becomes a noble profession while the so-called noble profession becomes dishonourable because of Lawyer Bonu.\nIt is also ironical that Aunt Fosuwa is pushing Maanan into the hands of Lawyer Bonu thinking that James will approve the relationship between the two whereas, it is not in the mind of James Ofosu at all. Aunt Fosuwa thinks Awere is a bad influence on Aaron whereas, Awere is Aaron's source of inspiration with regards to painting. Meanwhile, Awere advises Aaron to listen to his father concerning the choice of a career. Lastly, it is ironical that Aunty Fosuwa discourages Awere who is young and single, from having social contact with Maanan while at the same time encourages and supports the relationship between her and Lawyer Bonu who is old and married.",

This is against the belief of people like Cromwell and Norfolk who accept that there should be no contrary views to what the state dictates.

He believes in the authority that instituted the monarchy and placed it under the church. He sees the king's desperation to enlist the support of all the nobles in his bid to divorce Catherine as immoral. As King Henry wishes to have his dynasty continued through a male heir which Catherine has not been able to produce, the resultant conflict becomes the litmus test of the moral uprightness of the characters around him.\nTo achieve this aim, the king plans to sever England's link with the church of Rome and become the supreme head of the church of England.

He is used also as both a commentator and actor; that is, he performs the dual role of being both inside and outside the play. He is in various episodes of the play, a steward, a boatman, an innkeeper, jailer, the foreman of the Jury and the headsman.\nIn the play, the Common Man speaks directly to the audience explaining the action often in ironical statements. He connects the episodes and acts especially by his change of costume and utterances, thereby providing smooth transition. At the start of Act Two, for instance, the Common Man tells the audience about the events which have occurred between 1530, when the first Act ends, and 1532, when the second Act begins. It is also through the Common Man that the audience learns of Wolsey's demise and More's imprisonment, and it is the Common Man who informs the audi-ence of what befalls the other characters after the execution of More.\nThe Common Man often makes incisive comments on the other characters, and on events. For example, when he notices More's gift of the silver cup to Rich he says: \"my master Thomas would give anything to anyone. Some say that's good and some say that's bad ... \"\nThis is a very significant observation, for it is this cup which is used as evidence against More at the treason trial. The Common Man is able to see that More's generosity will get him into trouble. Also, he provides an insight into Rich's character when he says about him: \"That one'll come to nothing.\"\nIn addition, the few instances of humour in the play result from the Common Man's witty and sometimes startlingly realistic statements. When, for instance, More has lost his job and offers to retain his services if he will take a cut in wages, he comments after he has turned down the offer: \"Now, damn me isn't that them allover! \" Miss -? .. He - ... Miss -? ... Miss me ... What's in me for him to miss ... ? Wo - Ha! ... We - e - eyup!\" and tells the audience\" I nearly fell for it\".

When, for instance, More has lost his job and offers to retain his services if he will take a cut in wages, he comments after he has turned down the offer: \"Now, damn me isn't that them allover! \" Miss -? .. He - ... Miss -? ... Miss me ... What's in me for him to miss ... ? Wo - Ha! ... We - e - eyup!\" and tells the audience\" I nearly fell for it\". The Common Man is therefore a very important character in the play.",

On the side of tradition are 'the midwives of the spirit' who depend on intuition and feeling to prove the presence of pregnancy.\nThe conflict is therefore manifested in the different opinions each group has concerning the proof of the pregnancy. `The midwives of the spirit' claim that if they 'hear' a heart-throb when they put their finger on the navel, and 'feel a foetal throb', then, there is pregnancy.

In fact, the novel could have been appropriately titled The Sorrows of Motherhood. Indeed, Emecheta demonstrates that motherhood in the traditional African society which she presents can have no joy. The mothers presented in the novel have no joy. Agunwa, Agbadi's senior wife, dies in despair and shame after her husband has made love noisily to his mistress in their compound with everyone fully awake.\nNnu Ego, the novel's protagonist, demonstrates more than any other character the reward which mothers get in society. Here Emecheta's irony is at its most pungent, her sarcasm most virulent. Nnu Ego suffers pain and distress in her first marriage when she fails to bear children. Amatokwu, her husband unsympathetically packs her off to her father's house. Her problems result from her inability to be a mother. When Nnu Ego moves to Lagos and marries Nnaife, she does bear children - very many of them. Presumably she should be happy and contented now and enjoy a blissful life.

This does not stop him from inheriting his brother's young widow Adaku\u00a0and, running off to Ibuza to impregnate another of his brother's widows, Adankwo, a middle aged woman.

    "correct_answer": "Superstition plays an important role in the novel. It is a reflection of the culture and tradition of the people. It arouses the interest of the reader by highlighting the belief in the supernatural. Beliefs based on superstition dominate every facet of life in the society presented in the novel. The effects are more pronounced in the rural setting, but there are beliefs based on superstition even in the urban setting (Lagos). At the center of the concept of superstition is the people's belief in a supernatural power called 'chi'.\nThis is shown early in the novel when Nwokocha Agbadi is injured by the elephant he is hunting. Sacrifices are made by slaughtering goats to appease Agbadi's 'chi' and ward off the spirit of death hovering over his head. While superstitious beliefs reflect the culture and tradition of the people, these beliefs sometimes portray the society in a negative light. The burial of Agunwa's slave girl with her mistress offers a good example. This incident based on the belief that the spirit of the dead woman must be made comfortable in the hereafter, exposes the brutality of some of the customs of the society. As she is forced into Agunwa's grave, the slave girl warns: \"I shall come back to your household, but as a legitimate daughter\". When therefore, Ona gives birth to Nnu Ego, it is thought that the slave girl's spirit is within her controlling her destiny.\nThe problems of Nnu Ego are attributed to the slave girl's thirst for revenge and several medicine men are consulted in an effort to appease her. Here we see superstition advancing the plot of the novel. Superstition in some instances serves to destabilize families. This is seen in the dream which Oshia has in which he claims that Adaku, his stepmother, is chasing him. Nnu Ego runs off to the medicine man who performs some rites and gives them some charms which he claims will give the boy protection from Adaku for some money, of course. Thus the rift between the two women is further deepened. Superstition is also used to expose the credulity of the ordinary people who allow themselves to be gulled by charlatans parading as witch doctors. Some of the superstitious beliefs which lead people to be preyed on by these witch doctors are shown as ridiculous.\nThe humorous incident surrounding Nnaife's guitar is an example. When sounds coming from Nnaife's guitar hanging on the wall wakes up his family, the general belief is that an evil spirit has entered the guitar. The medicine man is called as usual and he confirms this, calling for sacrifices to get rid of the evil spirits. It turns out that Oshia had put some mice into the hole of the guitar several days earlier and they are now causing the noise coming from the guitar. Superstition is therefore important in the novel. In addition to reflecting the customs of the people, some beliefs also show how heartless some of the customs are and how other beliefs expose the people's credulity.",

The story focuses on the predicament of Oshevire and his-family but, the reader is never allowed to forget that a war is going on. War forms the background to the events in the novel. Several incidents point to the devastating_effects of a war situation. The war affects everyone involved physically, psychologically and emotionally_and this is quite apparent in the novel. The physical effects of the war are clearly in focus.\nHostilities result in the death of soldiers as well as innocent civilians. In some cases whole families are completely wiped out and valuable property destroyed. As Major All puts it \" The war is still on and every moment is pregnant with danger\". Ali's effort to \"maintain an atmosphere of calm, understanding and mutual respect\" do not seem to be having any measure of success. An atmosphere of fear, insecurity and uncertainty pervades the society. The war situation leads to a break-down of law and order. In this situation, a sergeant can shoot and kill a rival over a girl. The sergeant's summary execution can only take place in a situation in which chaos and anarchy rules in spite of the best efforts of the military authorities. The traumatic effects of the war are illustrated in the predicament of Oshevire's family.\nThe deprivation which Aku suffers makes her an easy target for exploitation by the unscrupulous Toje, who has even used the war to frame Oshevire. Oghenovo, Aku's son suffers terribly. Apart from the fact that he has been deprived of his father's company, his friend Onome taunts him that his father is in the prison because he is a thief. He is thus emotionally traumatized. The injustice of Oshevire's detention on the spurious charges orchestrated byToje clearly shows that in a war situation, no one is safe. From the events in the novel, the general impression one gets is that war is evil and should be avoided.",

In some cases whole families are completely wiped out and valuable property destroyed. As Major All puts it \" The war is still on and every moment is pregnant with danger\". Ali's effort to \"maintain an atmosphere of calm, understanding and mutual respect\" do not seem to be having any measure of success. An atmosphere of fear, insecurity and uncertainty pervades the society. The war situation leads to a break-down of law and order. In this situation, a sergeant can shoot and kill a rival over a girl. The sergeant's summary execution can only take place in a situation in which chaos and anarchy rules in spite of the best efforts of the military authorities. The traumatic effects of the war are illustrated in the predicament of Oshevire's family.\nThe deprivation which Aku suffers makes her an easy target for exploitation by the unscrupulous Toje, who has even used the war to frame Oshevire. Oghenovo, Aku's son suffers terribly. Apart from the fact that he has been deprived of his father's company, his friend Onome taunts him that his father is in the prison because he is a thief. He is thus emotionally traumatized. The injustice of Oshevire's detention on the spurious charges orchestrated byToje clearly shows that in a war situation, no one is safe. From the events in the novel, the general impression one gets is that war is evil and should be avoided.",

    "correct_answer": "Silas Marner's life experiences in Lantern Yard and Raveloe are played out under two contrasting backgrounds or settings. Lantern Yard and Raveloe present Silas in different lights; the former beginning pleasurably and ending in bitterness while, the latter begins in bitterness and ends in joy. In Lantern Yard, Silas' life begins on a hopeful note, full of expectations and trust.\nThe company of friends like William Dane and other members of the church means the whole world to him. Silas has faith in God and expects to live a fulfilled life. Silas' engagement to Sarah and friendship with William Dane and the others show that he believes in \u201epure, natural human relations\". In Lantern Yard, Silas' hope of being vindicated by God is shattered by the lot which the church casts that turns against him. Knowing fully well that he has not stolen the church's money as suspected, he feels disillusioned. The betrayal he suffers when his betrothed Sarah is snatched by his best friend, William Dane, can only drive him into `exile' to a new land, Raveloe.Thus, Silas' life in Lantern Yard begins as pleasurably as it ends in bitterness. Overwhelmed by betrayal, hopelessness and loss of faith in human relations, Silas' life in Raveloe begins in bitterness as he keeps aloof from his neighbours. Silas' life in Raveloe is best determined by the reactions of the villagers.\nAt first, they are suspicious of him, feeling that his knowledge of medicinal herbs may be the result of his dealings with the devil. This is made worse by his withered and pale looks, short-sightedness and the occasional cataleptic fit he suffers. All these affect his gentle, loving nature since his truthful simple, soul has been bitterly hurt. Thus, Raveloe provides Silas with the hideout he needs to work and just earn his gold coins which he cherishes with absorbing passion. In Raveloe, Silas makes for himself 'an eager life tilled with immediacy which fenced him from the wide, cheerless, unknown.\n'Though a barren life, with `no relation' to any other being, it is in sharp contrast with the life in Lantern Yard, where friends are full of deceit and disappointment. Silas is full of despair when his gold is stolen. His wish is to get back his treasure and not to hurt anybody. Raveloe creates an environment for Silas to prove that he has never lost his capacity for kindness and affection. He finds the child Eppie who reminds him of his little sister, and he takes refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit' Thus, Silas' life which begins in bitterness in Raveloe ends in joy as Eppie helps him realize that there's good in this world ... in spite of the trouble and the wickedness.' As Eppie chooses Silas instead of her real father Godfrey, Silas is consoled at last and feels vindicated even as his gold is recovered.",

This relationship goes a long way in shaping Richard's personality as well as his perception of life. The first instance of their relationship is unfolded during the fire that engulfs their house. Richard hides under the burning house afraid of the consequences of his action after the desire for adventure leads him into setting the house ablaze. Being too terrified to heed the mother's call to come out of his hiding place, the father's voice which should have brought him relief does otherwise. The father barks at him 'There he is!', 'Come here boy!', 'Come out there, you little fool'\nThus, Richard does not have the trust and sense of belonging a child feels for his father. As he feels the pain of almost being beaten to death by his mother, he knows his father will not save the situation. When the family moves to Memphis, the true relationship between Richard and his father is brought to the limelight. Here, Richard realizes to his chagrin that he cannot make noise or play freely during the daytime because that is when his night porter father sleeps. This situation evokes negative feelings in Richard who sees the father as all-important, forbidding and the family law giver. Richard never laughs in his father's presence and this makes him sullen and withdrawn.\nHe looks upon his father with as much awe as he would a stranger. All these lead to a loose relationship between Richard and his father. For instance, to spite his father, Richard decides to kill the kitten since the father complains that its noise disturbs his sleep. Richard literally takes his father at his word to \"kill that damn thing\" just to demonstrate his hate and thus have a triumphant edge over him by questioning his authority in the family. When his father deserts the family, the initial feeling of freedom he enjoys to play as noisily as he likes is gradually replaced by 'pangs of hunger' which he associates with the memory of his father. Thus, the father's desertion paves the way to the development of an independent mind in Richard as he learns to defend himself on the street. It, however, has a negative influence on him. He learns to indulge in 'loose street habits, becomes an alcoholic (as a child), uses obscene language and drops out of school for lack of support.'\nThe relationship between Richard and his father makes him to exhibit rude behaviour to the pastor who reminds him of his father. After watching the mother drag his father to court for financial assistance to no avail, Richard feels like killing him, especially after seeing him with a strange woman. Richard associates his mother's ill health with the father's desertion and this makes him feel deep hatred for him. Later in life, Richard relates the father's uncaring relationship with the family to the emptiness which every Blackman feels.
