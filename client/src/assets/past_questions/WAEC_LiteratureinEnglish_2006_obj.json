    "explanation": "Heroic Couplet:\u00a0A heroic couplet is a poetic form consisting of two rhymed lines written in iambic pentameter. Iambic pentameter is a meter in poetry where each line consists of five iambs, which are metrical feet with one unstressed syllable followed by one stressed syllable. In the context of a heroic couplet, each line has ten syllables (pentameter) and follows the pattern of iambs. The rhyme scheme is usually AABB, meaning that the first and second lines rhyme with each other. So, when you encounter a poetic structure with two lines of rhymed iambic pentameter, you can identify it as a heroic couplet.",

In this context, the phrase suggests that the benches have backs, which is a human characteristic. In reality, benches don't have literal backs as humans do, but the author uses personification to describe them as if they possess such features. This figurative language helps convey a vivid image of the scene and adds depth to the description of the old men sleeping in the station.",

    "explanation": "Rhyme refers to the repetition of similar sounds at the ends of lines in poetry. In the given poem, there is a clear use of rhyme scheme, particularly in the second and fourth lines of each stanza. For example:\n- \"Sleep, O sleep\" and \"I cease to weep\" rhyme.- \"By thy power\" and \"Enjoys the happy hour\" rhyme.- \"What's to sleep?\" and \"So may I always keep\" rhyme.\nThis consistent pattern of rhyming pairs throughout the poem indicates the use of rhyme as a poetic device.\nEnd-stopped lines are also used in the poem\n\"Sleep, O sleep\" ends with a comma, creating an end-stopped line.\"Charm my Imagination,\" also ends with a comma, indicating another end-stopped line.\nThese pauses or stops help to emphasize the completion of a thought or idea within the line itself.\nHowever, it is important to note that\u00a0rhyme is more dominant than end-stopped lines. The poem's structure relies heavily on rhyme, as evidenced by the consistent rhyme scheme throughout the stanzas. Each stanza follows a rhyme scheme.\nOn the other hand, while there are some end-stopped lines in the poem (lines that end with punctuation, creating pauses or stops), they are not as prominent or defining as rhyme.",
