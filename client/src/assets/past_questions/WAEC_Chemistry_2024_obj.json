    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "High boiling point is primarily caused by\u00a0strong intermolecular forces, particularly hydrogen bonding\u00a0which is the main reason for water's high boiling point, as water molecules can form multiple hydrogen bonds with each other, requiring more energy to separate them and vapourize. Consequently, water, ethanol and aquous sodium chloride would have relatively high boiling points, owing to the presence of hydrogen bonds while tetrachloromethane has no hydrogen bonding, hence, it is has the lowest boiling point.",

    "explanation": "The oxidation of ethanol involves two steps:\u00a0first, ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde (ethanal), and then acetaldehyde is further oxidized to acetic acid (ethanoic acid).\nEthanol (CH\\(_3\\)CH\\(_2\\)OH) is oxidized to acetaldehyde (CH\\(_3\\)CHO).\u00a0This process involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from the carbon atom that is bonded to the alcohol group (-OH).\u00a0Acetaldehyde (CH\\(_3\\)CHO) is then further oxidized to acetic acid (CH\\(_3\\)COOH).\u00a0This involves the addition of an oxygen atom to the carbon atom that is bonded to the aldehyde group (-CHO).\u00a0Strong oxidizing agents like acidified potassium dichromate (K\\(_2\\)Cr\\(_2\\)O\\(_7\\)) or alkaline potassium permanganate (KMnO\\(_4\\)) are commonly used to oxidize ethanol.",
