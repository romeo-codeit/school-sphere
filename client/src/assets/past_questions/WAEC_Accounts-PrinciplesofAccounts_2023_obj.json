However, among the options provided, the following are commonly recognized as potential sources of funds for local governments/district assemblies:Common fund allocation: Many countries allocate a portion of national revenue or taxes to local governments/district assemblies through a common fund. This fund ensures that local governments have a guaranteed source of funds to carry out their responsibilities and provide essential services to their communities.Excise duties: Excise duties are taxes imposed on specific goods or services within a country. Local governments may receive a portion of excise duty revenues collected within their jurisdiction as a source of funding for their activities.Road tolls: Local governments may generate revenue by implementing tolls on specific roads or highways within their jurisdiction. The funds collected from road tolls can be used to finance road maintenance, infrastructure development, and other related projects.Foreign loans: Local governments/district assemblies may also have the option to seek external funding through foreign loans. This involves borrowing money from international financial institutions or foreign governments to finance specific projects or initiatives.",

    "explanation": "The paid-up share capital is the portion of the share capital that has been paid by the shareholders.In this case, Taurus Ltd has issued three million ordinary shares at GH\u2284 0.60 per share. This means that the total value of the issued shares is:3,000,000 shares * GH\u2284 0.60 per share = GH\u2284 1,800,000The company has made calls of GH\u2284 0.40 per share, and all calls have been paid by shareholders except for GH\u2284 100,000 owing from one shareholder.So the total amount of calls that have been paid is:3,000,000 shares * GH\u2284 0.40 per share = GH\u2284 1,200,000Therefore, the paid-up share capital is the total value of the issued shares minus the total amount of calls paid, which is:GH\u2284 1,800,000 - GH\u2284 1,200,000 = GH\u2284 600,000Therefore, the correct answer is GH\u2284 600,000.",

    "explanation": "Overhead costs, also known as indirect costs, are expenses that cannot be directly attributed to a specific product or service. Instead, they are costs incurred to support the overall operations of a business. Examples of overhead costs include rent, utilities, insurance, administrative salaries, and equipment rental fees.In the case of a building construction company, the cost of hiring a crane would be considered an overhead cost because it is not directly associated with the manufacturing or production of a specific building. Instead, the crane is utilized to support various construction activities and is used across multiple projects.While the crane's rental cost is necessary for the construction company's operations, it does not fall under the category of a direct manufacturing cost because it is not directly involved in the transformation of raw materials into finished products. It is also not an administration cost because it is not related to the general administrative expenses of the company, such as office supplies or salaries of administrative staff.",
