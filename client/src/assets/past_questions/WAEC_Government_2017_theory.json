    "options": {},
    "answer_url": "https://myschool.ng/classroom/government/50496?exam_type=waec&type=theory&page=3",
    "correct_answer": "(a).A De Jure One-Party Systemis a system where the law or constitution officially permits only one political party to exist and operate within the state. In this system, other political parties are either outlawed or severely restricted. The ruling party holds a legal monopoly on political power. An example is the Communist Party of the Soviet Union during the USSR era.\nA De Facto One-Party System,on the other hand, is where, despite the legal allowance for multiple political parties, only one party dominates the political landscape. This dominance might be due to various factors such as repression, manipulation of the electoral process\u00a0or widespread influence. An example is the The African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa during the early post-apartheid years.\nFour Advantages of a Multi-Party System include:\n1.Encourages Diverse Representation:A multi-party system allows a broader spectrum of political views and ideologies to be represented in government. This diversity ensures that the interests of various social, economic\u00a0and ethnic groups are considered in the political process.\n2.Promotes Healthy Competition:Multiple political parties compete for power, which encourages parties to develop well-thought-out policies and platforms to attract voters. This competition can lead to more innovative and effective governance solutions.\n3.Enhances Democratic Participation:With more parties to choose from, citizens are more likely to find a party that aligns with their values and beliefs. This increases voter engagement and participation in the democratic process.\n4.Prevents Dictatorship:A multi-party system reduces the risk of dictatorship or authoritarian rule by ensuring that no single party can easily monopolize power. The presence of multiple parties provides checks and balances on the ruling party or coalition and makes it difficult for any one group to control the government indefinitely.\nOthers include:\ni. It is democratic because the people have the freedom to join any party of their choice\n(ii). There is room for opposition which guarantees good governance\n(iii). It checks arbitrary use of power\n(iv). The electorate has a wide range of choosing leaders/policies or programmes\n(v). It enhances wider political education\n(vi). It ensures\u00a0political accountability and transparency\n(vii). It caters for the interest of the minority\n(viii). Encourages healthy competition among the various political parties\n(ix). It caters for all shades of political opinions\n(x). It reflects genuinely the political differences that exist in a given society or state\n(xi). It enhances political participation.",
