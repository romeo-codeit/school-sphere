The other options, however, can be limiting factors:\nA. Food: The availability of food can limit the growth and production of aquatic organisms.\nB. Temperature: Temperature can affect the metabolism, growth, and survival of aquatic organisms.\nD. Sunlight: Sunlight is essential for photosynthesis, and its availability can limit the production of aquatic plants and, in turn, affect the entire aquatic food web.\nSo, the correct answer is Option C -\u00a0Water.",
