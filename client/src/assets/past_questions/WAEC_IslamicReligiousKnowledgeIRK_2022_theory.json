    "correct_answer": "The following are some of the significance of intentions as contained in Hadith 1 of an-Nawawi collection:- Intentions are conditions for the acceptance of any action.- No reward for anyone who does action for the sake of something else.- Whoever intends an action for the sake of Allah but could not do it due to unavoidable circumstances, would still be rewared by Allah.- Intentions help to distinguish between different acts of Ibadah(Worship) e.g Asr from Salatul-Ishai: both are four rakahs but intentions help to distinguish it.- It differentiates between ordinary actions and acts of Ibadah(worship)- Ordinary action can turn to worship because of intentions.",

    "correct_answer": "His full name is Umar ibn Al-Khattab ibn Nufayl ibn Abdul- Uzza. He was known as Abu Hafs and earned the nickname of Al Farooq (the Criterion) because he showed his Islam openly in Makkah and through him Allah distinguished between disbelief and faith. He was born in 583 AC (Cristian Era), thirteen years after Amul-Fil (the year of the Elephant). His father was Al-Khattab ibn Nufayl, and his grandfather Nufayl was one of those whom Quraish Tribe used to refer for judgment. His mother was Hantamah bint Hashim bin Al Mugheerah.Umar spent half of his life in the pre-Islamic society (Jahiliyah), and grew up like his peers of Quraish, except that he has an advantage over them in that he was one of those who had learned to read, of whom there were very few. He bore responsibility at an early age, and had a very harsh upbringing in which he knew no type of luxury or manifestation of wealth. His father Al-Khattab forced him to tend his camels. His father's harsh treatment had a negative effect on Umar which he remembered all his life.From his early youth he also excelled in many kinds of sports, such as wrestling, riding and horsemanship. He enjoyed and narrated poetry, and he was interested in the history and affaires of his people. He was keen to attend the great fairs of the Arabs such as Ukaz, Mijannah and Dhu al-Majaz, where he would make the most of the opportunity to engage in trade and learn the history of the Arabs, and the battles and contests that had taken place among the tribes. Besides, he engaged in trade and pro\ufb01ted, which made him one of the rich men of Makkah. He became acquainted with many people in the countries that he visited for the purpose of trade. He travelled to Syria in the summer and Yemen in the winter. Thus, he occupied a prominent position in Makkan society during the pre-Islamic era.Umar (R.A.) was wise, eloquent, well spoken, strong, tolerant, noble, persuasive and clear of speech, which made him quali\ufb01ed to be an ambassador for Quraish, to speak up for them before the other tribes. Ibn Al-Jawzi said:\"The role of ambassador fell to Umar ibn Al-Khattab. If there was a war between Quraish and another tribe, they would send him as an ambassador, and if another tribe was boasting against them, they would send him to respond in kind, and they were pleased with him.\"Before converting to Islam, Umar (R.A.) opposed Islam and he even threatened to kill Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W). He was adamant and cruel in opposing Messenger of Allah (S.A.W.) and very prominent in persecuting Muslims.The \ufb01rst ray of the light of faith that touched his heart came on when he saw the women of Quraish leaving their homeland and travelling to a distant land because of the persecution that they were facing from Umar (R.A.) and other unbelievers. His conscious was moved and he felt remorse and pity for them, and he spoke kind words to them which they had never expected to hear from his person beforehand.Umm Abdullah bint Hantamh said:\"When we were migrating to Abyssinia, Umar, who used to persecute us mercilessly, came and stood over and said to me: are you leaving? I said: Yes, for you have persecuted us and oppressed us, and by Allah we are going out in the land of Allah until Allah grants us a way out.\"Then Umar said:\"May Allah be with you. And I saw kindness that I had never seen before.\"Umar was moved by this woman's attitude and he felt distressed. How much suffering the followers of this new religion were putting up with, but despite that they were standing \ufb01rm. What was the secret beyond this extraordinary strength? He felt sad and his heart was \ufb01lled with pain. Shortly after this incident, Umar (R.A.) became Muslim as a result of the prayers of the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W.), which was the main reason for his acceptance of Islam. The Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W.) had prayed for him saying:\"O Allah honor Islam through Abu Jahl bin Hisham or through Umar bin Al-Khattab.\"Umar (R.A.) came the next day to the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W.) and accepted Islam.(Tirmidhi: 3683)Umar became Muslim in 616 AD, one year after the Migration to Abyssinia, when he was twenty-seven years old. He accepted Islam three days after Hamzah (R.A.), the Prophet's uncle.",

The phrase recognizes that human knowledge of the future is limited, and that all that may or may not come to pass is under the control and knowledge of God.However, people are not predestined by Allah to go to hell. Rather, people will only bear the sins that they themselves commit with free will and no one will be responsible for another person's deeds.

    "correct_answer": "Have an intention (niyat) to pray.This is not anything you have to say out loud (unless you are catching up on missed prayers and need to remind yourself on which one you're on). Rather, your intention to pray salat comes from the heart.Hold your hands up, palms facing forward, to perform Takbiratul Ihram.The individual raised their hands up, palms facing forward, to their ear lobes and recited Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest) out loud.Perform Qiyam.You are still standing at this point. Your hands are either folded across your chest (right over left) or hanging near your side (depending on whether you follow Shia or Sunni sect of Islam). You can now begin reciting the first chapter in the Quran, Surah Al Fatiha. You can recite this Surah either out loud or inside your head. This is followed immediately by another Surah (portion) of the Quran. It is helpful to have various small Surahs memorized.Perform Ruk'u.This is the part where the individual unfolds their hands, places them on their knees, and bows. When moving to this position, say Allahu Akbar. Whilst in this position, recite Subhana Rabbiyal al-Adheem (All praises to Allah, the great) three times.Rise up from Ruk'u.When rising, say Sam'i Allahu liman hamidah (Allah listens to those who praise Him) followed by Rabana walakel hummed (Our lord, to you is due to all praise).Perform Sujud (prostration).This is the position where Muslims are on their knees, palms flat on the floor with their forehead to the ground. Say Allahu Akbar when going into this position. Recite Subhan rabbi alAla (Glory be to my Lord, the Most high) three times.Rise to a sitting position.Say Allahu Akbar whilst moving into this position. Keep your palms on your knees and eyes focused on your prayer.Prostrate again.Recite Allahu Akbar while prostrating into Sujud. This prostration is just like the first one.Stand up back into the next raka'at (portion of prayer).Again, recite Allahu Akbar when moving into this position. This second portion of the prayer is identical to the first one (qiyam, ruk'u, sujud, sit, sujud). The difference in this raka'at is that you will not stand up again after the second prostration.

Rather, your intention to pray salat comes from the heart.Hold your hands up, palms facing forward, to perform Takbiratul Ihram.The individual raised their hands up, palms facing forward, to their ear lobes and recited Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest) out loud.Perform Qiyam.You are still standing at this point. Your hands are either folded across your chest (right over left) or hanging near your side (depending on whether you follow Shia or Sunni sect of Islam). You can now begin reciting the first chapter in the Quran, Surah Al Fatiha. You can recite this Surah either out loud or inside your head. This is followed immediately by another Surah (portion) of the Quran. It is helpful to have various small Surahs memorized.Perform Ruk'u.This is the part where the individual unfolds their hands, places them on their knees, and bows. When moving to this position, say Allahu Akbar. Whilst in this position, recite Subhana Rabbiyal al-Adheem (All praises to Allah, the great) three times.Rise up from Ruk'u.When rising, say Sam'i Allahu liman hamidah (Allah listens to those who praise Him) followed by Rabana walakel hummed (Our lord, to you is due to all praise).Perform Sujud (prostration).This is the position where Muslims are on their knees, palms flat on the floor with their forehead to the ground. Say Allahu Akbar when going into this position. Recite Subhan rabbi alAla (Glory be to my Lord, the Most high) three times.Rise to a sitting position.Say Allahu Akbar whilst moving into this position. Keep your palms on your knees and eyes focused on your prayer.Prostrate again.Recite Allahu Akbar while prostrating into Sujud. This prostration is just like the first one.Stand up back into the next raka'at (portion of prayer).Again, recite Allahu Akbar when moving into this position. This second portion of the prayer is identical to the first one (qiyam, ruk'u, sujud, sit, sujud). The difference in this raka'at is that you will not stand up again after the second prostration. Rather, you will go into Tashahhud.",
