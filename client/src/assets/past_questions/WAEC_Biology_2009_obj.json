The acid environment triggers a conformational change in pepsinogen,allowing it to convert into pepsin.\nThis mechanism ensures that pepsin is only activated when it is needed. i.e Whenever food is ingested through the mouth and gets into the stomach, and helps protect the stomach lining and other tissues from damage.",
