    "explanation": "(a)(i)\nThermally generated electrons from the filament are accelerated through high P.d and focused by the focusing cathode to a target. The energy of the impending electrons is converted mostly into heat which conducted through the copper anode. A small percentage of the energy is converted into X-rays which are radiated from the target through the window.\n(ii) Energy transformation:\n(b)(i) Hardness is the strength or penetrating power of the x-ray.\n(ii) Intensity is the energy radiated per unit time per unit area.\n(c)(i) Uses of x-rays:\n- Cure of cancer\n- Radio therapy\n- Detection of fracture in bones\n- Radiography\n- In metals to detect defect and fractures\n- In agriculture to kill germs\n- Analytical tool in crystallography\n- To detect metallic weapons\n(ii) Hazzards of over-exposure to x-rays; causes\n- leukemia\n- tissue damage\n- cataracts\n- skin burn or cancer\n- genetic mutations with undesirable heredity\n- baldness\n- graying.",
