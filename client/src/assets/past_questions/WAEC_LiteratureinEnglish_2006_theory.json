    "correct_answer": "The Dramatic Technique used in the play is mimicry.\nMimicry is used as a vehicle of comedy. The effect of mimicry is brought out in the narratives of Styles and Buntu. Through the use of mimicry, Styles and Buntu are able to act the roles of their characters without losing the thread of their narratives and also sustain the attention of the audience.\u00a0 Another techniques is the use of the dramatic monologue. Most of what Styles tells the audience in the first half of the play is said in monologue. Every aspect of his narrative is dramatized and gives us an indication of setting and time.Flashback is extensively used in the play. Flashback not only provides background information to the action of stage, but, also provides insight into the seamy side of apartheid.Symbolism is also used in the play.\n(a) Styles' photographic studio symbolizes the place where the dreams of the downtrodden blacks are recreated to give them a sense of self importance and meaning in life. The camera is a symbol of art. Through it the neglected dreams, aspirations and history of the black South African are captured and maintained.\n(b) There is also the symbol of the newspaper which reinforces those images captured by the camera.\n(c) Candidates may also refer to the symbolic presentation of the war on cockroaches as well as the passbook. Both enact the dehumanization of the blacks by the whites.\nThe epistolary style is another technique used. This is seen in Sizwe's letter to his wife, Nowetu. It is mnemoni\u00a0and helps to record as well as recreate the apartheid experience. Comedy is also used to ridicule the racist regime and its assumed sense of white supremacy. There is comedy the mimicry of Styles and Buntu, in the speech of \"Bass\" Bradley to the black workers at Ford Motors, in the war on xckroaches, in the infectious laughter of Styles and in the use of invectives.",

    "correct_answer": "Comment on the theme of the search for identity in the play.central to the play is the theme of the search for identity. The cruel system of apartheid pitched against the black man has not only destroyed him psychologically, it has succeeded in eroding the fundamental aspects of his personality that go to make up his identity - self-respect, pride, dignity, status, etc.\nMost of the characters in the play are caught up in the complex web of character denigration to the point where they have accepted it as a way of life or at most look for corrupt ways around their predicament. Zola houses Sizwe\u00a0illegally and when caught in one of the police raids is forced to go and live with Buntu. Buntu is compelled by economic exigencies to father only one child who does not even live with them because his wife works as a live-in maid and only mimes over for weekends. Outa Jacob's sad story of labour, rejection and death adds to the tale of woe for the Blackman, and Sizwe Bansi's coming over to Port Elizabeth is also fated to go through similar, if not worse, experiences, even after the corrupt acquisition of Robert's passbook. If Styles is redeemed by his singular act of setting up his own office in order to regain his self-respect, Zola, Buntu, Sizwe and others are doomed to follow the path of Outa Jacob.\nThe encounter of Sizwe and Buntu with the dead body of Robert Zwelinzima highlights the theme of the search for identity. The crucial point here is that the passbook has been used as a tool of denying the Blackman of an identity. The Blackman is no longer a living being with a personality and an identity, he is a piece of information kept in a computer. So the death of Robert Zwelinzima and the resurrection of Sizwe in his stead symbolizes the death of the identity of every Blackman in South Africa and their concomitant existences as ghosts. Buntu tells Sizwe: When his little child calls you 'Boy' You a man circumcised with a wife and four children Isn't that a ghost? .... Be a real ghost\" the point here is that a man's identity encompasses his dignity, self-respect and pride which if he is bereft of, he :eases to exist. Sizwe's confusion in asking Buntu \"I'm all mixed up. Who am I?\" is quite significant in bringing out the identity crisis that faces every South African. Style's photographic studio is very important in restoring the denigrated image or identity of the black man. Quite significantly, it is the Blackman's picture which is used to represent his identity in his passbook; therefore, the pictures Styles takes of the Blackman are a complementary effort to rebuild the image of the Blackman and place him in the ght perspective in the history of South Africa. Styles himself tells us: This world and its laws allows us nothing, except ourselves. There is nothing we can leave behind when we die except ale memory of ourselves\" there is certainly a distinction between the way the Blackman wants to be regarded and the way he is perceived by the white man. It is this, more than anything else, that forms the basis of the identity crisis in the play.",

    "correct_answer": "\"Our society is sold on money nothing is worth anything unless it brings money\". How does this state-ment reflect an aspect of the conflict in the play?\nThis statement is made by Aaron Ofosu, one of the youngest children of James Ofosu, out of frustration and anger. James Ofosu who is the father, is not well educated but is hardworking, determined and a self-made businessman. He -Las great plans for his children, Aaron and Maanan. The conflict begins when Aaron and Maanan reject their father's choice for them to become \"professional men and women\". James views this rejection as disobedience. Aaron wants to be an artist and Maanan a dancer. According to their father, painting or Art is not work and frowns on it. He also disapproves of Maanan taking up dancing as a career. He is therefore disappointed because he works hard \"to give them the best profession that any rich man's children can have\". His main reason for rejecting Aaron's choice to become an artist is money. His son will not make enough money if he is a painter. In Maanan's case, dancing is for illiterate girls and women. As a loving and caring father, he has spent a lot of money on her education, paying boarding fees at Achimota, one of the most expensive and prestigious boarding schools in Ghana. In his opinion, Art and Dancing are not respectable professions. He does not have half of the opportunities that he is now offering to his son and so he feels disappointed that Aaron does not appreciate his efforts to fit him into \"a respectable profession\". Teaching is not a respectable profession either, for, teachers are not paid for their services:\n\"the measure of a man's importance in any community is how much that community is prepared to pay him for his services\"\nHe also adds:\"the first lesson that anybody who wants to get on in life must learn is, Yes, money. Money is what matters, money is power! Money rules the world\"\u00a0James is not convinced that there could be money in painting, when his first son mentions that Portrait Painters make quite a lot of money. In the end, he is persuaded to change his mind when he hears over the radio that a painting has\u00a0been bought for two hundred and twenty pounds! In the end, the play upholds the children's view that one should do what one loves to do and not for money.",

She accommodates their friend, Awere, whom James does not want to see around the house, harbouring the belief that Awere is a bad influence on Aaron. Hannah is very observant.

Her assertiveness is highlighted in the way she defends the innocent relationship between Maanan and Awere against aunt Fosuwa's insinuations that they are lovers.\nShe is independent-minded and therefore complains about living in the same family house with the extended gift relations, especially the nosy aunt Fosuwa.

He visits More at the opening of the play where Rich is introduced to him by chance as an applicant. He eventually finds Rich employment in an effort to please More.\nTheir friendship becomes strained on the matter of the king's divorce bid and subsequent re-marriage to Anne Boleyn, Norfolk's niece. The Duke contends that More's opposition to the bid is mere theory and absurd. This proves :hat he is a man of principles. He so well understands More that he can predict his movements.\nHe never wavers in his love and sympathy for More despite their differences on the king's issue. He shows more :oncern for More when he resigns the chancellorship on the firm belief that the action of the king does not lead to a reformation but to war against the church.\nAfter Cromwell's interrogation of More at Hamption Court, the Duke speaks repeatedly in More's defence urging him\u00a0to \"for think and repent of his obstinate opinions. It is only when Cromwell speaks threateningly of the king's wishes that the Duke appears to acquiesce in the matter of More's persecution. Again, this shows that he, Duke, takes their friendship seriously.\nThe Duke again after More's interrogation advises him to accede to the king's wishes.\nIn fury More insults the Duke but the Duke still manages to show considerable patience before finally losing his temper. At the Seventh Court Commission hearing the Duke and Cromwell almost quarrel openly at the manner in which. Cromwell is questioning the accused man.\nDuring More's trial for high treason, the Duke appears more considerate and restrained than Cromwell. He re-states that More's life is in his own hands as it has always been hoping and pleading that More should shift ground but to no avail.\nIt is logical from the above to conclude that the Duke's relationship with More is sustained to the end. Ironically, he has the unfortunate responsibility of presiding over More's trial for high treason and pronouncing the death sentence.",

He shows more :oncern for More when he resigns the chancellorship on the firm belief that the action of the king does not lead to a reformation but to war against the church.\nAfter Cromwell's interrogation of More at Hamption Court, the Duke speaks repeatedly in More's defence urging him\u00a0to \"for think and repent of his obstinate opinions. It is only when Cromwell speaks threateningly of the king's wishes that the Duke appears to acquiesce in the matter of More's persecution. Again, this shows that he, Duke, takes their friendship seriously.\nThe Duke again after More's interrogation advises him to accede to the king's wishes.\nIn fury More insults the Duke but the Duke still manages to show considerable patience before finally losing his temper. At the Seventh Court Commission hearing the Duke and Cromwell almost quarrel openly at the manner in which. Cromwell is questioning the accused man.\nDuring More's trial for high treason, the Duke appears more considerate and restrained than Cromwell. He re-states that More's life is in his own hands as it has always been hoping and pleading that More should shift ground but to no avail.\nIt is logical from the above to conclude that the Duke's relationship with More is sustained to the end. Ironically, he has the unfortunate responsibility of presiding over More's trial for high treason and pronouncing the death sentence.",

    "correct_answer": "The conflict between Sir Thomas More and the authorities. The conflict between Sir Thomas More and the authorities in the play is very significant. It is through this conflict that Robert Bolt works out his principal themes; it is also this conflict which reveals the aspects of Thomas More's character that makes him \"a man for all seasons\". This conflict further shows the extent to which men could go in order to achieve their selfish ends.\nThe major conflict in the play, that between Sir Thomas and the authorities can be regarded as that between private judgment (represented by Sir Thomas) and constituted authority (represented by the king, Cromwell, Norfolk, Rich and others). The conflict comes to a head over Sir, Thomas' refusal to take an oath acquiescing to the Act of Succession passed by parliament. The Act conflicts with More's conscience. He has been clear all alone on his attitude to the king's intentions to divorce Catherine and marry Anne. Perhaps a little naively, More makes his stand clear during the king's visit to him, at the risk of offending Henry. Naive More may be, but we are impressed by his sincerity and honesty. An oath is important to him, and does not see how he could take the oath glibly without risking damnation.\nThe themes of sincerity, honesty and dignity are in focus here. It is clear from More's arguments that he is not refusing to give his consent out of personal spite. He loves the king and his country. He does not relish giving up his position of honour. As he sees it, there is nothing he can do about it. More puts his faith in the law even though he is perceptive enough to realize that evil men might twist the law to suit their purpose. He holds on firmly to both religious and moral principles even though he finds himself in a cynical world in which every man has his price. He is in a world\u00a0in which the Thomas More are hopelessly and outrageously outnumbered by the Richard Riches, the Cromwells and the Norfolks. He succumbs when Rich testifies against him. The betrayal is too much for him to bear. He is indeed \"a man for all seasons\" because his character is untainted no matter the circumstances in which he finds himself.\nThe forces raging against More are formidable. Authority is embodied in the person of the king who by the time More goes on trial is head of the church and state. The king appears only a couple of times but he leaves one with the impression of a rugged and determined man who will ignore the niceties of conscience in order to achieve his objectives. On the king's side, are Norfolk, Cromwell and Rich. These men demonstrate moral degeneration of the most odious kind. Rich in particular appears hideously tainted because of his betrayal of More's trust. Cromwell is an opportunist and an instrument of the king. Norfolk is not man enough to follow the dictates of his conscience and allows himself to be manipulated by the king.",

    "correct_answer": "The poem presents the destruction wreaked by a violent African thunderstorm on both people and nature itself. Rubadiri uses a lot of poetic devices to portray the storm as an agent of destruction in a most vivid way:\n1.(a) Similes: There is the use of several similes in the poem. In the second stanza alone, there are two of such similes. The poet compares the gathering rain clouds to \"a plague of locusts\" emphasizing its destructiveness.\n(b) Simile is also used to express the manner in which the storm tosses up everything on its way \"like a madman chasing nothing.\"\n(c) Then, we are told that the threatening clouds and the storm hover over everything and everybody \"like dark sinister wings.\" This presages doom and disaster.\n2. The use of personification invests the thunderstorm with a peculiarly destructive personality; everything gives way before it. \"The wind whistles by\", Trees bend to let it pass\" as \"the pregnant clouds/Ride stately by\" and cause a lot of inconvenience to all around. Both animate and inanimate objects are affected; clothes were \"like tattered flags\" and women's \"dangling breasts\" are exposed.\n3. Onomatopoeia abounds in the poem. \"Clinging\", \"dangling\", Rumble\", \"tremble\" and \"crack\" all convey a sense of force and noise echoing the various sounds made by the thunderstorm in its bids to destroy.\n4. Repetition of lines like \"The wind whistles by\", \"trees bend to let it pass\", adds to the power of the thunderstorm.\n5. There is also the apt choice of diction. Words like \"hurrying\", \"turning\" express in their continuous tenses the immediacy of the impact of the storm on things around.\n6. Contrast: The 3rd stanza sharply contrasts the behaviour of children and women to the storm. The children, on the one hand, in their blissful naivety welcome the storm while the women, on the other, rush madly moving things out of the destructive storm's way.",

The first two lines are an invitation to celebrate this lady:\n\"Behold her, single in the field, Yon solitary Highland Lass!\"\nThe narrative structure combines statements with rhetorical questions from start to finish. It is thus responsible for the ranges of sorrow and excitement that constitute the mood of the poem. The call on all creation to celebrate the solitary reaper, the travelers. Nightingale, cuckoo and the earth itself illustrates Wordsworth's pantheistic view of nature.\nSimile is another device used in the poem.

The contrast is especially heightened when distant lands, the Hebrides and Arabian sands relive the sorrow in the reaper's song.\nThe rhetorical question heightens the tension:\n\"Will no one tell me what she sings\".\nThis triggers off a chain of possible answers: plaintive numbers, history, romantic ditties, battles and everyday occurrences such as love, joy, birth, maturity and death are simultaneously invoked and made to evoke complex emotions.\nDiction is yet another device used in the poem.

    "correct_answer": "The effectiveness of Houseman's use of imagery in \"To an Athlete Dying Young\". Houseman uses imagery very effectively to express his major themes in the poem. The most important themes are mutability, pessimism and doomed youth. The poem is elegiac and focuses on the supposed achievement of the dead youth rather than on any loss which his death may have brought.\nMany of Houseman's images in the poem express the transience of life on earth. There is a preponderance of metaphors which focus on this. The world becomes \"fields where glory does not stay\" from which the dead youth has departed untimely. The world is a place where \"early though the laurel grows / it withers quicker than the rose\". The suggestion is that in our world, fame does not last, that in fact it fades (\"the laurel\") even more quickly than beauty (\"the rose\") does.\nHouseman throws up the athlete's image as a celebrated compatriot, champion and a man of the people. He was always celebrated as a hero any time he won sports honours and laurel. Both the old and the young always mounted informal guards of honour on roadsides to cheer him and carried him shoulder \u2014 high round the town. Upon his death, the whole town including his sportsmen never abandoned him. His corpse was equally taken round mournfully.\nSeveral metaphors also express the theme of pessimism. Death, destitution and suffering are seen as inevitable in this world. Thus, Houseman suggests that the dead youth has gained rather than lost in his fate. He has been transported from a world in which youths are doomed to suffer. He \"will not swell the rout/of lads that wore their hours out\". This metaphor suggests the inevitability of desolation, frustration and disillusionment. So also does the metaphor \"Runners whom renown outran\". Rather than settle for a life of disillusionment in this world, the youth has gone to his grave early in his life.\nHouseman paints an image of the athlete as a dear soul to his people, even in death, judging from the befitting burial given him. The athlete is portrayed as a man full of untapped resources right to his grave.\nDeath might be welcome to provide escape from the vicissitudes of life, but Houseman's images create an atmosphere of fatalism and a mood of resignation. He uses somber images to relate to death. The grave is a \"stiller town\", death is a \"shady night\", the youth is being laid to rest \"on the sill of shade\" and the dead are \"strength less\".",

    "correct_answer": "The causes of violence in the novel. Violence has been a major feature of the American society since the advent of the Blackman in America. Richard Wright's Black Boy gives a detailed and largely faithful expression to the phenomenon of violence in that society. Violence, as portrayed in Black Boy, emanated from three principal sources. These are racial discrimination, quest for dominance and domestic tension. Racial discrimination in the novel is manifested whenever instances of brutality, segregation and injustice are meted out against blacks on account of their colour. There is enough evidence in Black Boy that Whites brutalise Blacks under the idea that the latter are sub-human and so do not deserve any humane treatment. Instances of brutality leading to violence are as follows:\n(a) Avenues for employment are closed to blacks. They are therefore confined to menial jobs and reduced to poverty. They therefore resort to petty thievery and violence against each other. Indeed a white boss becomes surprised when a black employee is not for longtime discovered to have stolen something. This is a major cause of white violence against blacks.\n(b) The White man in the American society appears to be convinced that the Black man is sub-human and does not deserve to be treated as human. The blacks are therefore continually the victims of violence from whites. Richard Wright is hit with a bottle between his eyes because he failed to address a white man \"sir\". Richard does not receive any treatment from his white boss when the boss's dog bites him because \"dog bite no harm nigger\". These and other incidents lead to violence.\n(c) The Richard-Harrison fight is another evidence of racial discrimination. The white push them to maul each other to satisfy their sadistic tendencies while the poor black boys suffer.\nThe quest for dominance among blacks is also another source of violence. Here, reference may be made to the street children who attack Richard, beating him and snatching his money from him. The money was given to him for shopping. The mother sends him back mainly to fight back and secure his right to Memphis streets. After fighting and defeating the boys, he declares that he has indeed acquired his right to the streets.\nA third source of violence is the domestic tension always unfolding in Richard's home. There is, first of all the frequent beatings Richard's mother receives in the hands of the father. This breeds a sort of tension in Richard which always threatens to break out.\nThe fight between Richard and Aunt Addie over religious differences and which spilled over to the school is also the result of the domestic tension going on all the time.\nThe killing of the kitten meant to embarrass the father is also a kind of violence in the home. There is also the setting ablaze of the house which is also evidence of violence.",

This is the first episode in which\u00a0e shoes its hand.

This is an act of fate which contributes to the development of the plot. On the night - which the deacon dies, Silas is attacked by another fit and he comes to only to wonder why William Dane has not believed him to his watch al the Deacon's house or noticed the demise of the deacon.\nEarlier, Silas uses his knife to cut a strap for William without remembering to put his penknife back into his pocket. On the mourning after the Deacon's death, Silas' knife is found in the house and the bag containing the church's money disappears. The empty bag is later found in Silas' house. The disappearance of the money and the discovery of ate empty bag in Silas' place are all acts of fate to move the plot forward.\nBecause of his strong faith, Silas believes that the drawing of lots to find the thief will exonerate him from all suspicion. To his utter chagrin the lot falls on Silas who knows that he has not stolen the church's money.\nThe engagement between Sarah and Silas is broken even though there is no religious reason for doing so and this obviously another act of fate. later on in the story, William Dane marries Sarah and Silas decides to leave Lantern Yard because he believes that :sere is no God and that if there is any he must be a god of lies.\nSilas moves from Lantern Yard to Raveloe because he has lost all faith in God and man and wants to have no --finds and to worship God. He settles in a stone cottage outside the village of Raveloe weaving for anyone who can pay thle price without visiting anyone; his customers come to visit but all such are on purely business visits. The villagers have all kinds of stories about him but he neither hears nor cares about the speculations of human beings. He now has a new form of entertainment; playing with his gold coins, packing them back into their bag and placing it under the floor board before going to bed.\nFrom the villager's point of view, Silas has not really becomes a part of the village because all citizens of Raveloe must attend the Cass' parties, visit the Rainbow, the local pub fairly regularly and go to church at least once in a while. Silas has not attended even one of these places since his arrival in Raveloe.\nThen, Silas heals Sally Oats of a heart condition and everyone wants Silas to heal his disease but Silas ignores all their appeals because he is not a doctor and does not want to be anyone's friend. That Silas knows the herb that heals Sally Oats is another act of fate which brings people close to him, but he withdraws into his shell \u2014 Silas has human feeling and sympathizes with the pain of others.\nThen, Dunstan Cass steals the bag of Silas' gold. Once his only plaything disappears, Silas walks through the rain to the Rainbow to ask if anyone has news about his missing money. It is the hand of fate that caused Dunstan to steal Silas' gold. He is distressed and feels even more lonely than before.\nNot long afterwards, on the night of another Christmas party at the Cass' home to which Silas does not go, Silas comes home to find a golden haired toddler sleeping on his hearth. He initially thinks it is his gold come back but upon touching it discovers that it is soft. He cuddles the little girl and goes to the Cass party to announce his find and seeing that there is no claimant, decides to keep the child.\nSilas becomes a changed man and does anything that is suggested by his neighbours to be to the good of the child that he names Eppie. The arrival of the child is another example of fate and by the time his gold is discovered and handed back to him and Eppie gets baptized and Aaron comes to ask for the hand of Eppie in marriage, fate has worked full cycle on Silas. He has become acceptable to the village of Raveloe because he has fulfilled all the requirements for anyone to become a citizen of Raveloe.",

To his utter chagrin the lot falls on Silas who knows that he has not stolen the church's money.\nThe engagement between Sarah and Silas is broken even though there is no religious reason for doing so and this obviously another act of fate. later on in the story, William Dane marries Sarah and Silas decides to leave Lantern Yard because he believes that :sere is no God and that if there is any he must be a god of lies.\nSilas moves from Lantern Yard to Raveloe because he has lost all faith in God and man and wants to have no --finds and to worship God. He settles in a stone cottage outside the village of Raveloe weaving for anyone who can pay thle price without visiting anyone; his customers come to visit but all such are on purely business visits. The villagers have all kinds of stories about him but he neither hears nor cares about the speculations of human beings. He now has a new form of entertainment; playing with his gold coins, packing them back into their bag and placing it under the floor board before going to bed.\nFrom the villager's point of view, Silas has not really becomes a part of the village because all citizens of Raveloe must attend the Cass' parties, visit the Rainbow, the local pub fairly regularly and go to church at least once in a while. Silas has not attended even one of these places since his arrival in Raveloe.\nThen, Silas heals Sally Oats of a heart condition and everyone wants Silas to heal his disease but Silas ignores all their appeals because he is not a doctor and does not want to be anyone's friend. That Silas knows the herb that heals Sally Oats is another act of fate which brings people close to him, but he withdraws into his shell \u2014 Silas has human feeling and sympathizes with the pain of others.\nThen, Dunstan Cass steals the bag of Silas' gold. Once his only plaything disappears, Silas walks through the rain to the Rainbow to ask if anyone has news about his missing money. It is the hand of fate that caused Dunstan to steal Silas' gold. He is distressed and feels even more lonely than before.\nNot long afterwards, on the night of another Christmas party at the Cass' home to which Silas does not go, Silas comes home to find a golden haired toddler sleeping on his hearth. He initially thinks it is his gold come back but upon touching it discovers that it is soft. He cuddles the little girl and goes to the Cass party to announce his find and seeing that there is no claimant, decides to keep the child.\nSilas becomes a changed man and does anything that is suggested by his neighbours to be to the good of the child that he names Eppie. The arrival of the child is another example of fate and by the time his gold is discovered and handed back to him and Eppie gets baptized and Aaron comes to ask for the hand of Eppie in marriage, fate has worked full cycle on Silas. He has become acceptable to the village of Raveloe because he has fulfilled all the requirements for anyone to become a citizen of Raveloe.",
