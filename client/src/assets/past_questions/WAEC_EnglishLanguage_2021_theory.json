    "correct_answer": "Government Secondary School\nObio Usiere, Eniong Abatim.\nOdukpani L.G.A.\nCross River State.\n13th September, 2021.\nDear Ekpika,\nI am very happy to write this letter to you. How are you and your studies? I hope that you are doing well in all areas of your endeavours. I am quite alright in health and in my studies. My dear friend, Ekpika, I have the pleasure to relate to you the valuable lessons I have learnt on the recent excursion. Our tourism mistress, Mrs. Uionkpan Odey announced to all students in Ss3 that\u00a0twe will embark on an excursion to Yankari National Park, located in Bauchi State, in the north eastern Nigeria, on 20th May, 2021. On that day, we left Obio Usiere for Bauchi State. The bus carried eighteen students and two teachers including our tourism mistress Mrs. Urionkpan Odey. On the arrival in Bauchi, the state capital, we were directed to Yankari Game reserve in the south-central part of Bauchi state.\nThe park is the most developed wildlife park in Nigeria with a lot of attractions for visitors. The park is famous for its variety of animals for viewing. We went there in the month of May, because that is the period of the year that the animals converge around the Gaji River, Baboons, Waterbucks, Elephants, Crocodiles, Bushbucks, Duckers, Warthongs, Hippopotamus were some of the animals that we saw at the park\nThe surrounding\u00a0environment was very captivating with hills, valleys and plains, beautifully wrapped up, such that one cannot ignore its sceneries that are inspiringly blended. I also\u00a0learnt that the Yankari national park has another famous attraction- The Wikki warm spring. The spring is particularly prized for its warm water. The spring is available both night and day for excursion and for tourism. It was one of the best experiences I\u00a0have had in the recent past.\nThe excursion was an opportunity for me to learn\u00a0more about the animals in their natural habitat. I saw elephants, crocodiles, hippopotamus and other animals I used to see before on television, face to face.\nThe excursion was part of the school learning programme. It was a cherished break from the traditional classroom teaching and learning. Indeed travelling is a part of education. The excursion was quite necessary. I took notes of everything we were taught.\nWe were advised to conduct ourselves in an orderly manner. The manner of the park, Dr. Shehu\u00a0Bello conducted us to the reception side of the park, and served us a very delicious meal. There, I learnt table manners, especially while eating with important dignitaries and other students.\nWe were trained on how to swim. Now I can swim without making use of life-jacket. Again, I learnt how to paddle a canoe. Now I can paddle a canoe with a wooden or plastic paddle.\nMoreover, the excursion has afforded me the opportunity to know so many states in Nigeria. As a result of the route we took, we passed through Nassarawa, Yobe, Gombe and Adamawa North Eastern part of Nigeria.\nFinally, I wish to let you know that the valuable lessons I have learnt from the excursion will live long in my memory and will continue to influence me positively in my future educational pursuit.\nThank you very much for the textbooks you sent to me. Take your studies very seriously. Stay well till l visit you. Bye.\nYours sincerely,\nInyang.",

    "correct_answer": "ALARMING RATE OF INDISCIPLINE AMONG THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY\nIndiscipline is the opposite of discipline, Discipline is a situation where every citizen of a country behaves in an orderly manner, obeys the laws of the land and respects the constituted authorities anytime or anywhere. But alas, all these cannot be realized among the youth of my country, Nigeria.\nThe youth of my country do not respect their parents at home. The youth exhibit immoral behaviours openly, not minding their parents, or other elderly people in the society. They do not have restrain in their conduct. This is so pathetic. The youth then used to respect the elders, possibly helping them in manual and domestic works, but now the story is different. The youth rather insult, abuse and flagrantly disrespect the elderly persons in the society. The youth smoke hallucinogenic drugs like Indian hemp popularly called marijuana, tramadol and all sorts of intoxicants, that make them ruthless and indisciplined.\nAnother reason responsible for the alarming rate of indiscipline among the youth of my country is the incessant cases of cultism. The youth that joined cults groups believe that they are on top of the world. They feel that they are superior to any other person who is not a member of any cult group, claiming that since they have access to guns and other dangerous weapons, they can maim, injure or even kill anybody that might want to restrain them on his way.\nAnother factor responsible for the alarming rate of indiscipline among the youth of my county is the inducement by our politicians. The politicians used the youth to cause mayhem to political opponents during elections, by providing them with guns and other dangerous weapons. After the election, the politicians may not be able to retrieve all the weapons from these youth. The youth will in turn\u00a0use these weapons for armed robbery, kidnapping and on many occasions, the youth use the weapons to attack law enforcement agents, like the police or the army. Cases abound where such youth attacked the police in their stations, killed the officers and collect AK 47 from them. In most cases the culprits are caught and detained for further investigations, only to be released by the police because some of the leading politicians have gone to the station and paid a large sum of money to bail them out of detention, One may ask, who are those supporting the indiscipline of the youth is attributed to the decay in the societal my country? The answer is the politicians.\nMoreover, the indiscipline of the youth in the country can be attributed to the decay in societal norms. The traditional values like respect, honesty, humility, integrity and dignity of labour ar\u00e9 no longer held in high esteem. Now the youth of my country do not want to submit themselves to the traditional and cultural heritage of their fatherland, They tend to imbibe foreign culture which has affected their psychological, social and moral orientation.\nAnother reason for the alarming increase in the rate of indiscipline among the youth of my country is that the youth want success without hard work. They placed much premium on money without minding who is hurt or not, provided they get the money. The parents and the society do not help matters. The parents push their children into drug abuse, prostitution, smuggling. thuggery. armed robbery and other crimes just to make money. Our philosophy of hard work and honesty are thrown into the wind.\nThe social media is another factor that has contributed to the alarming rate of indiscipline among the youth of my country. In our schools you see students coming to school with cell phones. Some have downloaded pornographic pictures and videos and foreign materials that do not build their moral behaviours. Even they walk along the streets with ear-piece fixed in their ears. This has caused them to be partially insensitive to their immediate environment. Some even get involved in avoidable accidents as a result of careless behaviours.\nThe churches and the mosques do not help our youth. The youth go to church and mosques dressed like prostitutes or hooligans. They dress half-naked to the church or mosque. They dress half-naked to the church or mosque. They do not reference God\u00a0in his sanctuary. Some will be busy pressing their phones while prayers and sermons\u00a0are going on.. some even discuss in the church while worship is going on. This is the greatest act of indiscipline.\nWhat can we do\u00a0to reverse this ugly trend of indiscipline among the youth of my country? The answers to this question are not far-fetched, The parents have an important role to play in this regard. They must inculcate moral discipline in their children. They must show examples to their children. They must show examples in behaviour and in character. They must encourage the youth by promoting good social values that will make them better citizens of this country.\nOur society should also promote values that will make every member of Our society to be disciplined. Criminal attitudes and deviant behaviours should be jettisoned. The youth should not be used as political thugs, because after their violent and criminal actions during elections, they will still remain in the society indisciplined. Again, political godfatherism should be discouraged. Any recalcitrant behaviour should be punished severly. Our education planners should include moral discipline in the school curriculum, to educate the students\u00a0on sound moral attitudes in the society. Ill-gotten\u00a0wealth should be investigated and the culprits be brought to book.\nIf\u00a0all the points suggested above are strictly considered, then alarming rate of indiscipline in my country, Nigeria.\nRichard Oyama.",

Every day in the last six\u00a0months had witnessed a rapid increase of malaria in all the thirty-six states in my country, Nigeria. According to medical reports, about six hundred people have died in the last six months as a result of malaria.\nMalaria is a parasitic disease caused by plasmodium, carried by female anopheles mosquito bites. Some of the symptoms include high fever, associated with shivering, sweating and sometimes severe dace. Malaria is deadly if proper medication is not administered by trained medical personnel, For example, in Kogi, Taraba and Akwa lbom states, the people resorted to self-medication and traditional methods for the treatment of malaria, The resultant effects were massive death of the citizens of those states in Nigeria.\nMalaria is a parasitic disease. it can be transmitted from infected person to uninfected person through a vector- an animal which transmits a disease-causing organism called pathogen, from the person\u00a0suffering the disease to another person. In the case of malaria, the female mosquito is the carrier of the disease.\nThe government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria through the Federal Ministry of Health should rise-up to the challenge posed by the deadly disease called malaria, in the country. No problem is insurmountable if all hands are on deck. The Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in conjunction with the federal ministry of health should do the following in order to curb or even eradicate malaria from the country. The entire population of this country must be educated on how to maintain good hygiene. Drainage of swamps that serve as the breeding ground for mosquitoes and clearing of bushes around our houses should be done to reduce the hiding places for adult mosquitoes. Broken pots and empty cans should be buried to eliminate possible breeding places for mosquitoes. Stagnant water should be drained or oiled sprayed on the stagnant water to reduce the Surface tension of water and prevent larval stages of mosquitoes from breathing, hence they will die.\nThe Government should provide drugs like chloroquine to cure malaria fever. The government should also provide every household with an insecticide mosquito treated net and enforce all the citizens\u00a0to use the net, to prevent mosquito bites. Insect repellent should be used on the body to repel or prevent mosquito bites. Also the use of biological control like the use of predators in the mosquito habitat to eliminate or eat up the mosquito larvae.\nThe Ministry of Health in conjunction with the Nigerian Association should advise the government on how to improve the health status of the citizens of Nigeria. They should also alert the country when and where there is an outbreak of diseases like malaria and carry out research into ways of preventing and controlling diseases.\nFinally, the Ministry of Health should monitor the recruitment of well-trained doctors in the hospitals and assist in the training and re-training of medical and para-medical staff needed in health care delivery. if all the suggestions given above are implemented malaria will be curbed if not totally eradicated in my country, Nigeria.\nYours Faithfully,\nEkpo Ita Bassey.",
