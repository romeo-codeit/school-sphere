It will be quite unfortunate if you involve yourself in such despicable act. I would like to highlight some of the dangers inherent in examination malpractices so that you can realize that nothing pays as hardwork.Tolulope, I hope you know that the punishment for anybody who engages in examination malpractice is twenty-five year imprisonment. This is quite scary and intimidating as it is not a joke for someone to be behind bars for twenty-five years. It is better imagined than being real because such years would be regarded as wasted.Secondly, the disgrace and social stigma that always accompany the ultimate loss of integrity, if you are caught, is also better imagined. Those who were caught engaging in examination malpractice in the past don't regain their integrity throughout their lives. They live in disgrace and humiliation for the rest of their lives and I known that you wouldn't want to bring such disgrace upon yourself. Apart from this, I am sure that you know that our parents would not be happy with you when they hear that you engage in examination malpractice.Moreover, examination malpractice destroys the intelligence and the confidence of whoever engages in it. Defi-nitely, when you depend on 'expo', as it is commonly referred to by students, you will loss your reading ability and, trust me, you won't be able to stop depending on it. This could be disastrous as you are likely to depend on examination malpractice for every other examinations you have to write.Lastly, I'm sure that you've heard the word 'nemesis'. It surely catches up with whoever engages in any evil practice. My brother, students might be involving themselves in examination malpractice and get away with it now but they always reap what they have sown later in life. This is the reason many university undergraduates find it difficult to cope with their studies after gaining admission into the university.I hope that you now understand that examination malpractice is not the way forward at all and I believe that you will desist from it. It is always better to work hard because it pays. Besides this, when there is no pain, there is no gain, so it will be more rewarding for you to concentrate on your studies than engaging in examination malpractice.Did you receive the success card that I sent to you? I know that you are brilliant and you can make it. Anyway I wish you the best. May the good Lord crown your effort with huge success.Yours sincerelyOlumide",

    "correct_answer": "VANDALISATION OF PUBLIC FACILITIES IN MY COUNTRY\nIt is a common sight in Nigeria to see public facilities vandalized. Street light, telecommunication cables, express roads or highway dividends and even pipe-lines are often vandalized by unscrupulous Nigerians. in almost all\u00a0our cities and towns, public facilities which are provided by government are damaged soon after they have been in-stalled. Vandalisation of public facilities is a thing that should give any Nigerian a serious. concern.\nThis is so because the rate at which these facilities are being vandalized is alarming and disturbing. The public street. lights which is meant to provide illumination at night to motorists and pedestrians alike are vandalized, thus throwing most of our major streets into darkness. The most outrageous vandalisation is that of the petroleum pipe-lines which mostly result in conflagration that destroys people and properties.\nVandalisation of public facilities is a direct result of our bad perception that government properties or facilities are nobody's properties. As a result of this, we are non-chalant about taking proper care of them. This makes some unscrupulous Nigerians to take delight in destroying public facilities without impunity. We often forget that government spends a lot of money in replacing these vandalized facilities and where government fails to replace them, many people suffer for the action of these few vandals.\nObviously, vandalisation of public facilities in my country is a negative trend that must be discouraged because of its effects. Firstly, foreigners living in the country see how Nigerians willfully vandalise public facilities which probably looks strange to them. As a result of this, the image of the country suffers as the country will be regarded as the country of vandals by these foreigners. Other countries will regard us as people who could not keep and maintain the facilities provided for them. Unfortunately enough, an average Nigerian will be regarded as a vandal who willfully destroys things.\nBesides this, vandalisation of public facilities can only lead us to wastage of tax payers' money. These facilities are provided with the money obtained through tax and their vandalisation is mere wastage of the money with which these facilities are provided. Government is not encouraged to provide more of these facilities as they have to replace them soon after they are put in place.\nVandalisation has resulted in loss of lives in the country. Most Nigerians have been killed through armed robbery at night while some other ones have lost their lives through ghastly motor accidents simply because they are traveling at night on the roads which are in darkness as a result of vandalisation of the light provided by government; More lives are lost through vandalisation of petroleum pipe-line which often explode as people scoop fuel from vandalized pipes.\nIn conclusion, vandalisation of public facilities should be condemned and discouraged. Stiffer penalties should be meted out to those who are caught vandalizing public amenities and there should be no sacred cows. Lastly, we need to re-orientate Nigerians towards making them regard public facilities as their own which must be jealously guarded and maintained by every Nigerian.\nBisola Adenrele",

Though Gwabi was a big city that was full of opportunities, these two friends toiled daily to eke out a living. It got to a time in their lives of struggle when they thought that they were dogged by misfortunes. Hard as they struggled daily to eke out a living. difficult was it for them to make an headway. \"I don't know why we are unlucky. Those who started after us are doing well\". said Francis. As despondent as Francis was, he continued to struggle hard with his friend, Chukwuma, serving as a source of encouragement for him. \"Don't be discouraged because I know that our own time will come\". Chukwuma always said to his friend and business partner.\nThe story that changed the misfortune of one of these two friends started with Chukwuma's business trip to Gwandu, a neighbouring city to Gwabi where he and his friend, Francis, were living. Chukwuma had traveled there to buy some metal scraps with which they would fabricate some tools in their workshop for a company that had asked them to make the tools for its factory. After buying the metal scraps, he ran into lfeanyi, another friend of theirs. Ifeanyi had become a successful businessman and he had just arrived from an overseas trip. Chukwuma narrated the hardship and difficulty he and his friend, Francis, were passing through in Gwabi. lfeanyi then promised to introduce them to a man who helped to give him the opportunity to break even in his business of selling vehicles.\nWhen Chukwuma got back to Gwabi, he told his friend how he met Ifeanyi and the promise that he made. Two weeks after Chukwuma and Francis set out for Gwandu to see Ifeanyi. They went to meet Ifeanyi in his office through the address he gave them. After entertaining them, he took them to Chief lberemadu who after listening to them promised to help at least one of them to travel abroad where he would have the opportunity to stay, depending on the readiness of any of the two friends to make a good use of the opportunity. Chief lberemadu asked them to come back in one week's time.\nOn the day that they were to come and see Chief Iberemadu, Francis woke up early in the morning to wait for his friend, Chukwuma at their workshop where they had agreed to meet by 5.30 am. He waited for Chukwuma to come for thirty minutes before setting out for Gwandu to see Chief lberemadu. Francis got to the Chiefs house at 6.45am and the Chief gave him the document with which he would travel abroad and a cash donation of five million dollars.\nChukwuma arrived Chief Eberemadu's house at 8.00arn with lfeanyi.

Sometimes it is the actual examination they fear but equally likely to excite fear are the expectations of the parents who are keen on their offspring results in failures which could be avoided. achieving good results. Pressure in these circumstances only leads to more fear and often results in failure which could be avoided.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My very last examination was an oral and I knew that everything depended on the kind of impression I made on the government representative who I expected, had difficult questions for me. This, though, was not the only reason for my apprehension. As a youth, I was often teased because I was small in stature. I was obsessed with it. I was very self-conscious, therefore, about meeting this important man. Fortunately, the previous day 1 had learned another lesson from nature, one which was to help me in my face-to-face encounter with the examiner.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had been staying with my aunt and uncle in order to do some last-minute preparations. I went through my books that afternoon, sitting outside in the sunshine until about three o'clock, when the weather took a turn for the worse. The sky looked menacing and, as the clouds gathered in the distance, I heard the rumble of thunder. The lovely sunny afternoon was changing to a dark and dismal evening. Several times I broke my concentration to look at a very beautiful water lily in the pond. As I quickly gathered up my books, I remembered the lily and went over to see it for the last time that day. I was just in time to see the flower close its petals as the rumble of the distant thunder grew louder. I didn't mind getting wet as I realized that the rain could do nothing to damage the delicate, inner beauty of the lily.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This simple act of nature restored my confidence and I realized that I too could muster courage to face the examiner. I could, in fact, protect the inner me from the outside world. My new-found philosophy worked! Of the eight people who sat for the examination that day, only two succeeded and the government representative congratulated me on being the youngest candidate ever to have passed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was lucky for I had learnt to control my obsession with my stature.\n(a) According to the writer, what two things excite fear in young people going for examinations?\n(b) Give two reasons for the writer's apprehension before the examination.\n(c) Why was the writer almost obsessed with his small stature?\n(d) How did the observation of the lily affect the writer?\n(e) What proof is there in the passage that the writer actually passed the exam?\n(f) The sky looked menacing ..... What figure of speech is contained in this expression?\n(g) .... because I was small in stature.\n(i) What grammatical name is given to this expression as it is used in the passage?\n(ii) what is its function?\n(h) For each of the following words, find another word or phrase which means the same and which can replace it as it is used in the passage: (i) excite; (ii) offspring; (iii) apprehension; (iv) dismal; (v) delicate; (vi) muster.",

In some countries, children are often involved in workshops and small-scale services, and gradually become full-fledged workers later in life. In other countries, teenagers work a few hours a week to earn pocket money. Such work is beneficial as it enhances a child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development without interfering with his schooling, recreation and rest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Child labour, on the other hand, is about children who work long hours for low wages. often under conditions harmful to their health. This type of work is destructive and exploitative. Child labour takes different forms. By and large, most child workers are in domestic service. Domestic service need not be hazardous, but it often is. Children in domestic service are poorly paid or not paid at all. Their masters set the terms and conditions of their work entirely to their whim. They are deprived of affection, schooling, play and social activity. They are also vulnerable to physical abuse.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Poverty is the most powerful force driving children into hazardous labour. For poor families, the small contribution of a child's income at home can make the difference between hunger and survival. The parents of child workers are often unemployed or underemployed. They are desperate for a secure income. In developing countries, for example, class-rooms do not have seats, half of the students have no textbooks, and half of the classrooms have no blackboards. It is not surprising that many children who attend such schools abandon schooling for work.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Child labour is aggravated by a modern society that is preoccupied with the demand for low-priced products. Few people seem to care that these may have been produced by millions of anonymous, \u00a0exploited children. The effects of child labour on the psychological, emotional and intellectual growth of the victims are grave. Such children are deprived of affection. Beatings, insults and punishment by being deprived of food are very common. Ultimately, most child labourers are condemned to lifelong poverty, misery, sickness and illiteracy.\n(a) Identify two types of work that are beneficial to children.\n(b) According to the passage, what is child labour?\u00a0\n(c) Give two causes of child labour.\u00a0\n(d) In one word, describe the effect of child labour on the child\u00a0\n(e) According to the passage, why do children drop out of school?\u00a0\n(f) .... who work long hours for low wages? (I) What is the grammatical named given to this expression as it is used in the passage? (ii) What is its functions?\u00a0\n(g) .... most child labourers are condemned to lifelong poverty What is the meaning of this expression?\u00a0\n(h) For each of the following words, find another word or phrase which means the same and which can replace it as it is used in the passage: (i) transmitting, (ii) enhances; (iii) vulnerable; (iv) preoccupied; (v) anonymous; (vi) grave.",

    "text": "Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many cities in the world have now become overcrowded because everyday people migrate to them from the country-side in search of work and better living conditions. This problem is far worse in Third World countries, where the harsh living conditions and the lack of gainful employment opportunities in rural areas usually compel a ceaseless and massive rural-urban drift.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This desperate state of affairs is not without its direct consequences for the cities. Facilities like accommodation, schools, hospitals, water supply and public transport cannot cope with the demands on them from increased numbers of people, and so they are under severe strain. House rents soar astronomically, and so too many tenants crowd into inadequate spaces. Markets, streets and motorways are congested with people and vehicles. And as the garbage disposal is inefficient, the garbage piles up everywhere, contributing to environmental pollution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many of the migrants come to the big cities in the hope of finding employment. However, because a majority of them are unskilled workers or fresh school-leavers not equipped in any way for gainful self-employment, they simply end up swelling the ranks of the desperate unemployed in the city.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The devil, they say, makes work for idle hands. With no means of livelihood in the relatively more expensive cities, many of these disillusioned young people resort to prostitution, fraud and crime in order to survive. No wonder the crime rate in the cities is for ever rising, and there are daily reports of victims who lose their money, possessions or even their lives to dare-devil robbers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How can this deplorable state of affairs in the cities be reversed? Since the search for jobs accounts for much of the rural-urban drift, one way is to encourage the creation of jobs outside the cities. For example, certain businesses such as banks and manufacturing industries could be encouraged to set up branches in rural areas. If rural dweller have ready access to the same jobs they go to look for in the city, the need for migrating will be reduced.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be admitted that in this modern age, life without the basic amenities of pipe-borne water, electricity, good roads, schools and hospitals is just not good enough. Many rural dwellers are lured to the cities because of the lack of amenities, so providing them in these rural communities will not only contribute to stemming the tide of migration but also create a favourable environment for investment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It has also been argued that rural farming is gradually being abandoned to the aged. The primitive, labour-intensive methods and the relatively low yields have made it unattractive to the youth, who would rather seek their fortune in the cities. If farming is made attractive, for example, through mechanization, it will become another source of employment for rural dwellers and thus reduce the necessity to migrate to the city.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rural-urban migration causes a serious population imbalance, and has all sorts of attendant problems that can get worse if not tackled effectively. So, the sooner a solution is sought the better.\n(a) In three sentences, one for each, summarize the three negative consequences of rural-urban migration discussed in the passage.\n(b) In three sentences, one for each, summarize the writer's suggestions for tackling the problem.",
