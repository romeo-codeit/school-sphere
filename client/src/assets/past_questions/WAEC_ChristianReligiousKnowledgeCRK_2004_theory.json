The assault started with a procession led by armed men of war, followed by seven priests with seven trumpets, while another group of priests formed the rear guard bearing the ark of the Lord, and simultaneously the trumpets blew continually as the procession marched around the city of Jericho once a day for six days. After each march, they came into the camp and spent the night there. There, they were warned not to shout until Joshua gave them the order to shout. On the seventh lay, they rose early and marched around the city in the same manner seven times. At the seventh time, when the priest had blown the trumpet, Joshua commanded the people to shout, adding that the Lord had given them the city. Immediately, people shouted and the trumpets were blown. As soon as the people heard the trumpet, they raised a great shout and the wall fell down flat. The people went straight into the city and took it. Joshua then instructed the people to destroy the city with fire and this was done.

    "correct_answer": "(a) Saul was made a king over Israel by Samuel and was told to hearken to the words of the Lord. The Lord made it known to him that He was going to punish the Amalekites for their opposition to the Israelites on their way from Egypt to Canaan and Saul was instructed to destroy the Amalekites and not to spare them but to kill both men and women, infants and suckling, oxen and sheep. In obedience to God's command, Saul and his army came to Amalek; laid in wait in the valley. He advised the Kenites who showed kindness to the Israelites to depart from the Amalekites to avoid being destroyed. The Kenites obeyed and departed from the Amalekites.\nSaul then defeated the Amalekites in a battle and spared Agag, their king against God's express command. He spared the best of the sheep, oxen, and all that were good, he only destroyed only what was worthless and despised. Saul defended himself rather weakly by stating that he spared the best of the sheep to offer sacrifice to God / He shifted the blame on the people. Samuel decried Saul's action and denounced his non-performance of the commandments given to him by God / to obey is better than sacrifice. For this act of disobedience, he was rejected by God. As Samuel turned to go away from Saul, he held Samuel's skirt and it got torn. Samuel then declared that as Saul had torn his robe, the Lord had torn the kingdom of Israel and had given it to his neighbour.\n(b) Lessons from Saul's Experience:\n(i) Disobedience leads to suffering and condemnation from God. Saul suffered greatly. God allowed evil spirit to torment him.\n(ii) Disobedience can lead to a tragic end. Saul lost his life along with his three sons in a battle,\n(iii) One man's disobedience can lead to the suffering of the whole nation as seen in Saul's.\n(iv) God's plan for our lives can be distorted through disobedience.\n(v) Obedience is better than sacrifice.\n(vi) The need to accept responsibility for our actions rather than blaming others.",

    "correct_answer": "(a) Paul in writing to the Thessalonians urged them to stick to the tradition of hard work, and should distance themselves from any brother living in idleness and, should imitate Paul and his men for they worked hard when they were in Thessaionica. Paul reminded the Thessalonians that he and his men did not eat anyone's food / bread without paying for it. \"We toiled and laboured day and night that we might not burden any of you\". \"We had the right but we only wanted to give you an example to copy\". He reminded them of the command which they (Paul and his men) gave them: when they were with them 'if any one will not work, let him not eat'. Paul and his men were surprised that in spite of this command, they still heard that some of them were living in idleness, becoming mere busy-bodies. He advised that such a person should be warned as a brother and not as an enemy. Such people should do their work and earn their own living.\n(b) How the Church can uphold the teaching today and eliminate idleness in the Society?\n(i) Trainning of inmates of orphanages.\n(ii) Establishing printing presses, bookshops and some other opportunities, etc.\n(iii) Preaching against idleness.\n(iv) Establishment of schools, hospitals, vocational centres for giving education to children and people generally.\n(v) Some churches have farm settlements, where people are trained for farm work.",

    "correct_answer": "(a) James emphasized the role of faith in producing effective prayer. He taught believers not to doubt when they pray. He compared any one that doubts with a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. According to him, a double-minded person, unstable in all his ways, will not receive anything from God through prayer. James confirmed that God answers prayers generously and will grant wisdom to anyone who asks for it in prayer. He taught that prayer can remove suffering and sickness of sin. James advised that elders of the Church should be called upon to pray over the sick and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord or the prayer of faith will save the sickman. Believers should confess their sins to one another and pray for one anther in order to attract God's healing and forgiveness of sin. James advised people who are cheerful to sing praises to God i.e. worship God in prayer. The prayer of a righteous man has great power in its effects / clean heart, clean soul. He illustrated with the prayer of Elijah who prayed fervently that it might not rain; and for 31/2 years, it did not rain. He prayed again and the heavens gave rain.\nb) Hindrances to\u00a0effective prayer.\n(i) Our prayers will not be answered if they are not according to the will of God.\n(ii) Prayers said thoughtlessly may not be answered.\n(iii) If we pray without faith, our prayers may not be answered.\n(iv) The presence of sin in our lives can lead to unanswered prayers / non-confession of sins.\n(v) We should not serve two Gods \u2014 God and mammon.\n(vi) Prayers from unforgiving hearts are usually not answered.\n(vii) Lack of perseverance.

    "correct_answer": "a) James taught that men of faith should do what they profess. For if they are mere hearers, they are like a man who observes his face in a mirror but soon forgets the image of his face. He asserted that God's blessings come through works and not faith. It is no profit if an ill-clad brother or sister who goes without food is admonished to go in peace without giving any assistance. He taught that faith and works should be inseparable; otherwise, faith is barren. He linked faith with true religion which involves visiting orphans / widows in their afflictions. Keeping away from the stain of sin / the world. It is not enough to believe in God because demons also believe in God and tremble. James cited Biblical instances of faith and works operating in unison. Abraham was justified not merely for his faith but for preparedness to sacrifice his son, Isaac. He was therefore, justified by works and faith and not by faith alone. Abraham believed God, acted on that faith and it was reckoned for him as righteousness. Consequently, he was called the friend of God. In the same way, Rahab, the harlot, was justified by works when she received God's / Joshua's messengers and sent them out safely after securing their lives.",
