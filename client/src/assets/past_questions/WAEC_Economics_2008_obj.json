This means that the tax is not directly deducted from the income of the consumer, but deducted at the point of buying goods and services.\nAn indirect tax is regressive in nature because everyone is made to pay the same tax rate. It doesn't take into consideration the income or social status of the buyer.\u00a0Since they are flat\u00a0taxes, they take a higher percentage of income on the poor than on high-income earners.",
