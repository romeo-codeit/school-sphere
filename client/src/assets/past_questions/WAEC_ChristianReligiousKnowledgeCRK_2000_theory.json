    "correct_answer": "(a)\u00a0 In the beginning, God made the earth and the heavens. There were no plants nor herbs because rain had not fallen. The Lord formed man out of dust (of the earth) and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, thus making him become a living being. God then planted a garden in Eden, put the man there and grew plants and the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Four rivers flowed on four sides to water the garden and the man was to maintain the garden. God directed the man to eat of all the trees but not the fruit of the tree of knowledge, for he would die any day he ate the fruit. The man was alone, hence, there was the need to find a suitable help mate. Then God created all living creatures and the man was charged to give them names. To provide the man a helper fit for him, God made from Adam's rib a woman, gave her to Adam as flesh of his flesh and Adam called her woman.\n(b) The functions assigned to man in the second creation story are as follows:\n(i) He was to act as God's agent in furthering the act of creation of various types of vegetation.\n(ii) He was to give names to all creations. This is a very important function because by knowing the name of a person or thing, you know his or its nature and can, therefore, exercise power over it.\n(iii) He was to eat of all trees and plants, but, never the tree of knowledge of good and evil. This order refects the dual nature of man, flesh and soul, good and evil. It is unfortunate that this dual nature was soon to play a negative role when flesh overtook soul while evil overtook good, leading to the fall of man.\n(iv) By his acceptance of Eve,woman, Adam acknowledged God's institution of marriage.\n(v) Man now has a right to choose between life and death.",

    "correct_answer": "Paul regards Christians as those who have been buried with Christ through baptism and risen with him through the resurrection. Such people are dead to sin; sin no longer reigns in their bodies. They must therefore live a new life, apply their minds to heavenly things and do away with their former life. Christians must do away with immorality such as impurity, passion, evil desires, greed, anger, bad temper, malice, slander and shameful language. Christians must not lie to one another because they have put on a new life. In the new life, there are no differences; Christ is all and in all. As God's chosen people, enjoying His love, Christians must show tenderness of heart, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience, endurance and bear one another's burden.\nThey should forgive one another as God has forgiven them and crown all their virtues with love which is the perfect bond of union. They should let the peace of Christ reign in their lives and be thankful. The enriching message of Christ should influence whatever they do. They should instruct and admonish one another in all wisdom with Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing in thankful spirit. Anything they do should be done in the name of Jesus.\n(b) Steps to be taken before initiation into New Life in my Church are:\n(i) The word of God should first be preached and heard.\n(ii) Confession of sin by word of mouth then follows after conviction and belief in the word heard.\n(iii) The third step is baptism.\n(iv) Determination to lead a Christ-like life as a full member of the church\n(v) Confirmation by the Bishop of the Church, after which he is entitled to partake in the body and blood of Jesus during Holy communion.",

    "correct_answer": "(a) St. Paul's letter to Philemon is an appeal to forgive his erstwhile slave, Onesimus and take him back. Onesimus had wronged his master and escaped. In his self imposed exile, he had come in contact with Paul (imprisoned in Rome) and had become a convert. He became closely attached to Paul by rendering useful service to him. Paul, therefore, sent him back to his master with a letter of appeal with the love of Christ. Paul began by congratulating Philemon on his love and devotion in the service of God, pointing out his immense joy for Philemon's goodness to the saints in the Church.\nPaul claimed that, although as his mentor and benefactor, he had a right to command, but for God's sake, he preferred to appeal to Philemon's good sense, and urged him to take back Onesimus, not so much as a slave, but more importantly, as a Christian brother. Onesimus had formerly, by his action, been useless to Philemon so that by becoming a convert, he might become more useful and worthy to be taken back.\nPaul said that he would have preferred to retain Onesimus, but the decision must be taken by Philemon himself. If Onesimus had owed him anything or made him suffer any financial losses, he should charge Paul's account; he would surely pay it during his next visit. He concluded by asking Philemon to prepare a guest house for him in readiness for his next visit.\n(b) Forgiveness is that mental attitude by which one overlooks an injury or wrong done to one by another, whether physical, mental or moral. Forgiveness restores broken relationship, especially when it is accompanied by forgetting the injury suffered. In fact, forgiveness is more or less divine (Only God can truly forgive); human beings merely pardon.",

    "answer_url": "https://myschool.ng/classroom/christian-religious-knowledge-crk/51915?exam_type=waec&type=theory&page=43",
    "correct_answer": "(a) Peter devoted much of his counsel to wives. He advised them to be submissive to their husbands, for by their good behavior, unbelieving husbands might be won over to God, especially in response to the reverent and chaste nature which they exhibited. Wives should not attach too much importance to external adornments, characterized by much use of trinkets, gold ornaments, hair braiding and flamboyant dressing.\nInstead, they should lay greater premium on moral probity which, before God, is as precious as an imperishable jewel. Wives should look up to Sarah as their role model. She hoped in God and referred to her husband, in obedience, as her Lord. If, as wives, they maintained her standard, they would rightly be her children, by faith. Turning to the husbands, Peter advised them to live considerately with their wives in accordance with their knowledge of God's character and will, knowing that women are the weaker vessel who should be treated with love and honour so that as joint heirs of the grace of God, their prayers might not be hindered by any ungodly action on their part.\n(b) Instability in the family is usually caused by mutual misunderstanding or incompatibility of character between husband and wife, and this often has far-reaching consequences. These are:\n(i) juvenile delinquency among the children in the family: With parents always at daggers \u2014 drawn and no love, children's home-training becomes defective. This adversely affects their behaviour.\n(ii) Lack of love or unity in the home: Often, this leads to open physical confrontation and inevitable disaster.\n(iii) Divorce: Where the love of God is compromised or non-existent, husbands and wives may end up in divorce. The rate of divorce is on the rise today due to extreme materialism and selfishness which characterize relationships today. Instability of the family leads to instability in the nation.",
