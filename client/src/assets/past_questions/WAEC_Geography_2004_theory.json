West and North of the map have rugged hills hence no transportation line exist. The eastern part is less rugged and therefore a secondary road runs across the south east. Footpaths are few and far apart because of high relief.\nSOLUTION 1 (C)The Western and Northern parts have rugged relief hence there Pre no settlements in the area. The, Eastern part too, is less rugged and has undulating upland hence there are very few scattered settlements. The whole area is high and inaccessible hence there are few settlements in the area. The area is sparsely settled because farming cannot be easily practised.",
