    "explanation": "-\u00a0Most frog species show little resistance to evaporative water loss (EWL) through their skin.\n-\u00a0The movement of water across membranes from areas of high concentration (lots of water) to areas of low concentration (less water) is called osmosis. The reason frogs do not have to actively drink water andinstead can sit in a bowl of water and absorb water passively is due, in large part, to osmosis.\n- That is, frogs do not drink like we do;they absorb water directly through their skinin an area known as the 'drinking patch' located on their belly and the underside of their thighs.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Drosophila melanogaster has been extensively used to test the chromosome theory of heredity.\u00a0It was instrumental in the early development of genetics, with Thomas Hunt Morgan and his team at Columbia University using it to provide strong evidence for the theory.\u00a0This work led to the formulation of the chromosome theory, which states that genes are located on chromosomes and that inheritance patterns can be explained by the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis.\nDrosophila have a short life cycle, allowing for quick observation of multiple generations, crucial for genetic analysis.\u00a0They produce many offspring, making it easier to observe patterns of inheritance.\u00a0They can be easily bred and maintained in a laboratory setting.\nDrosophila also possess polytene chromosomes, which are large and visible under a microscope, facilitating the mapping of genes.\u00a0They readily develop mutations, allowing researchers to study the effects of altered genes.",
