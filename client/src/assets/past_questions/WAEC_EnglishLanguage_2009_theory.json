    "correct_answer": "Ikeja Senior High School,Oba Akinjobi Street,lkeja.30th April. 2009.Dear Dad,\nHow are you? I hope that you are doing well. I also hope that you are in good health. It has been\u00a0quite a long time since I last\u00a0heard from you.The main reason for writing this letter is to tell you that I will soon leave my brother's house. I just have to let you know this so that you will not be disappointed in me when I pack out of brother Wale's house. I believe that when one has a younger sister, one should be able to protect and trust her. I believe when I explain to you, you will see reasons\u00a0why I should leave my brother's house.First of all, my brother does not trust me. He believes that I drink and bring friends to his house and I told him repeatedly that the allegation is not true but he never listens to me. Every effort to explain to him always earns me\u00a0punishment which in most cases results in flogging. I have endured this not because of anything but because he is my brother and I love him dearly.Secondly, my education has started to suffer greatly as it seems that my brother no longer has my interest at heart. It is ridiculous that anytime I get set to leave for school, my brother remembers that he needs some. thing from the dry cleaners or the market. This makes me get to school late every school day and almost everyday, I miss the first two lessons. The other day I missed my English Language test just because brother Wale asked me to. tidy up his room and get his clothes from his dry cleaner. When I told him that I had to go to school, he looked me up in the house and left. He didn't return until evening. I got to school when the test was far over. I kept quiet despite the shabby treatment I received from him for the reason I gave earlier on.Thirdly. I have been embarrassed beyond imagination by the actions of some of my brother's friends and his insensitivity to my plight. When his friends come around in the house, either to spend some time with him or watch a game, they make passes at me and he encourages them, going by his unconcern attitude. I have told him that I don't like such advances but he always laugh it off. saying there is nothing wrong about it, only if I can be a little 'friendly' with them. I kept my fears to myself until, one day. I was almost assaulted by one of his friends.The last straw that broke the camel's back is that my brother asked me to stop going to school. saying that he could joke no longer afford to pay my school fees. He insisted that I should go and get a husband for myself and start having children. It was like a joke to me when he said this but when he demanded that I leave his house if I insisted on going to school, I knew that he meant what he said. I\u00a0cried and begged but he didn't listen. Now I am fed up with him and I have made up my mind to leave his house. I am sure that you will now know why I am leaving his house and I hope that you don't mind me coming back home.I am sure this letter will get you worried but don't worry. I'll get over the problem. We will talk more about the problem when I arrive home. Greet everyone at home. I will see them soon till then, goodbye.Yours sincerely.Tina.",

As our History teacher had arranged with us: we all gathered in our school. Our mission? We were going on excursion to Badagry, a town we had been told hosted the first white missionaries in Nigeria. Besides, Badagry is prominent in the history of slave trade in West Africa. It is located on a borderline between Nigeria and the Republic of Benin.\nI remembered vividly our entry point into the town through the toll gate. It was as if we were ushered into a serene atmosphere especially when we consider the hustle and bustle of Lagos. Indeed. everyone of us in the school bus could not but get a feel of the overwhelming serenity of Badagry. It was indeed an unforgettable experience. We were welcomed by a prominent chief in the town who served as our guide\nThe first place we drove to was the first storey building in Nigeria. The building. which was still standing despite the fact that it was built several decades ago, was a sight to behold. It was marvelous and right beside it was the first well which was about three feet deep. According to our guide. Lord Lugard and d Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther drank from this well and the Bible was translated from English to Yoruba Language in the first storey building.\nAnother place we visited was the Badagry slave camp where we saw chains, whips, batons, bags of cowries, big padlocks. These relics depicted slave trade era and on the wall we re frescoes of slave chained together while being brutalized by the slave masters. At intervals, we were told dehumanizing tales of the untold hardships our fore-fathers went through during the period of slavery.\nBadagry beach was another exciting place to be. It was a place we could not have left out of our excursion because of the enormous thrills and fun it had to offer. At the beach we had fun, rode on donkeys, savoured the comfort of the thatch huts and enjoyed the rising and falling tides of the sea. The experience here is unforgettable.\nThe last place we visited was the whispering palms. According to our guide, the name was obtained from the belief that originated from the original dwellers of the area. It was believed that in the night, audible chants were heard emanating from the rustling palm trees which they believed whisper. Here we saw several caged animals, including tortoise and birds. We ate coconuts and played games. We didn't leave the town without paying a visit to the King's palace where we were entertained by cultural dancers.\nAt the end of the day, it was obvious that we had enjoyed ourselves. It was an experience I cannot forget in a hurry.\nOlatunde Kunle\nS.S 3c",

I am sure that some cases of bullying junior students by their seniors must have been reported to you. It has become. so rampant that something drastic has to be done urgently to arrest the situation. Most of the junior students are terrified because they are being forced, against their will. to do some wrong things as well as being forced to part with some things that belong to them.\nThere are several incidences of bullying in the school but I will tell you two of them. You will remember. Sir, a forth night ago, the case of a senior student who injured a junior student seriously in the head with a broken bottle. The incident was reported to your office but what is important is that it would have been averted if the junior student had not stood up against the senior student. What happened was that the junior student had a beautiful and expensive phone on him which he claimed his parents bought for him. The senior student wanted to collect the phone from him and when the junior student refused to give him. a fight ensued and the boy was seriously wounded. The conspiracy of the other senior students at the scene of the incidence further worsened the matter. They wanted to forcefully collect the phone, claiming that the junior student was not supposed to be in possession of a phone while in school. This type of incident often occurred in the school when junior students are mostly beaten up by senior students in order to dispossess them of their belongings.\nThe second incident was even ridiculous. A friend of mine who is in the junior secondary class was sent on an errand to buy biscuits by a senior student and was ordered to use his own money. I remember watching my friend crying because he had no money on him. Since he did not have the money, he went back to the senior student and told him that he could not buy him biscuit because he had no money on him. The senior student did not want to listen to him. He gave my friend some slaps and went under his bunk, packed some clothes for him to wash.\nSir. you have to do something about bullying in this school as it has caused a lot of disaffection among students. I would want to suggest some measures that can be taken to curb this act of bullying. Firstly. any senior student caught bullying a junior student, or even his own mate should be made to face the disciplinary committee of the school and he should be punished severely. I suggest that any bully caught should be suspended from school for a term and his parents should be invited to school to tell them the student's offence and the punishment meted out to him.\nSecondly. bullying should attract a public punishment. Instead of dealing with the offence in your office or in staff-rooms, any student found engaging in bullying should be flogged openly on the assembly on your instruction. If this is done it will serve as a deterrent to others who may want to bully their fellow students.\nI appreciate the good work you are doing to position the school on a high pedestal Thank you.\nYours faithfully.\nSignature\nLatilo Taiwo",

I am Etim Mary and I stand here before this distinguished audience to oppose the motion which states that: \"Parents should allow their children to choose their own careers.\"These are my points. Firstly. it is a well-known fact that experience is the best teacher and a famous African sage said that what an elder can see while sitting, a youth can not see it even from the top of a palm tree. Hence. I dare say that it is only proper for parents who as elders are more experienced. to choose careers for their children. Apart from this, parents as experienced people are better suited for the task of choosing careers for their children. This is because they understand what a career entails and as such will make a better choice of career for their children.Secondly. parents should choose careers for their children to ensure continuity of careers in their families. It is understandable that no individual would like to see his work or business run down because of mis-management, nor would anyone like to leave his business for a stranger to manage. For this reason, parents should choose careers which will better prepare their children for the task of continuing the family business even after they have passed on. This will not only ensure economic security for the children but will make sure that the family's legacy is not forgotten.In addition to this. naivety on the part of children can make them choose careers which they are not well suited for. This is so because most children are immature as at the age when they are to choose careers for themselves. It\u00a0is a known fact that at this age, they are easily influenced by peer influence and social trends. For example, a child may be quite good in arts subjects and would possibly become a lawyer someday, but he may be influenced by his friends to choose science subjects because it is perceived to be in vogue. The resultant effect on the society is that a potential advocate is lost and by the time such a child is disillusioned, he will realize only too late that he is not suited to be a science student. This can be avoided if parents who are more enlightened and know the ability of the child are allowed to choose a career for him.Lastly, parents are older, wiser and more experienced. They are not likely to be influenced by social trends but by the academic ability of their children in choosing careers for them. Besides, they always strive for the best for their children.I believe that with these points of mine, you have been able to see reasons with me that parents should not allow their children to choose their own careers but rather, this choice should be made for them by their parents.

On the first day in class, I told my students that they were mature enough to comport themselves in an exemplary manner without burdening them with stringent rules. I wanted them to like me and so I allowed them a lot of freedom. Unfortunately, I lost class control, and the students exploited the situation to disrespect me. Some would leave their seats without permission; freely throw objects like pens, rulers or crumpled pieces of paper to mates or talk with others.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 During the long vacation, I busied myself reading books on discipline and consulting seasoned colleagues for help. When we resumed-school the next session, I had formulated strategies on maintaining discipline. There were laid-down, rules such as \"students are to be courteous and silent when the teacher or a student is speaking to the class.' \"Students are to ask for the teacher's permission to leave their seats for anything\", \"Students are not to leave the class during lessons.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 After giving the class the rules that I knew were essential for class control, I made sure the students followed them \u00a0to the letter. I virtually enforced discipline myself instead of sending students to the Principal's office for disciplinary action as I did the previous year. After about a month, I realized that my efforts were yielding results.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Then, two months before the Christmas holidays, I began to relax some of the rules. One of them read as follows; \"Whenever any student wants to leave the class for any reason, he should come up for permission, provided he does this without disturbing other students.\" About one week later, I told the students that because they were not disruptive, they could whisper to one another, open or shut windows quietly without my permission.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Indeed, before the second term holidays, we had a classroom where students would come in and go on recess as they finished their class assignments and also where small group discussions on project work took place. Where a student in one group talked too loudly to disturb others, he was cautioned by the group, not me. Teaching then became a pleasure and I felt my students had matured greatly by learning to conduct themselves in a more acceptable way.\u00a0\n(a) Why did the writer not give his students rules initially?\u00a0\n(b) What was the outcome of the writer's desire for the students to like him?\u00a0\n(c) How did the students react to the writer's loss of class control?\u00a0\n(d) What did the writer do to change the unfortunate development in the class?\u00a0\n(e) What helped the writer to formulate measures to maintain discipline in class?\u00a0\n(f)\".. .before the second term holidays...\"\u00a0\n(i) What grammatical name is given to this expression as it is used in the passage?\u00a0\n(ii) What is its function?\u00a0\n(g) \"...I made sure that the students followed them to the letter \"What does the writer mean by this statement as it is used in the passage?\u00a0\n(h) For each of the following words, find another word or phrase which means the same and which can replace it as it is used in the passage: (i) stringent; (ii) strategies; (iii) courteous; (iv) essential; (v) yielding; (vi) cautioned.",

It is a war of Man versus Baboon. The conflict started when engineers built the magnificent bridge which skirts Victoria Falls and crosses the Zambesi River. That, apparently, gave the baboons the opportunity they were looking for. They swarmed from the jungle across the bridge in such numbers that trains were held up by chattering families of baboons. They swung from the girders and barked defiance at everyone \u2014 driver, guard and passenger.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recently, guests at the new tourist hotel at Victoria Falls have complained that trousers and other articles of clothing have been disappearing mysteriously at night. Socks, with suspenders attached, were found dangling from tree-tops in the nearby bush and it was realized that the baboons, not thieves, were the culprits from that time baboons became the declared enemy; Guests were entreated\u00a0not to give them buns on the lawn at tea-time or encourage them in any other way.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A period of comparative peace followed, and then, a few weeks later, the baboons embarked on a hew campaign at the new international airport at Livingstone. At first they confined themselves to racing across the runways when planes were coming in to land, but when one of them was found asleep in the cockpit of a southbound airliner, it was felt that the time had come for a drastic action. Then the authorities installed electric flares embedded in concrete alongside the runways. Only once did the baboons demonstrate in full force against the glare of the lights, attacking with sticks, stones and fists; but the light stood up to the onslaught, and the attackers retreated.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next stage in this strange conflict will be the erection of an electrified fence round the perimeter of the airport. Such shock tactics, it is expected, will result in the baboons conceding defeat and completely abandoning their guerrilla warfare. But grey-headed Matabeles who have dwelt all their lives in the Zambesi Valley shake their heads gloomily. They have a legend that if the baboons disappear from Victoria Falls the river will dry up, and \"The smoke that Thunders\" will thunder no more.\n(a) What was the reaction of the baboons after the new bridge had been built?\n(b) What incident caused those in control at the airport to deal seriously with the baboons?\n(c) What did the airport authorities do to forestall further intrusion by the baboons?\n(d) What does the writer suggest as the final solution to the baboon problem?\n(e) What fear do the Matabeles have about the efforts to get rid of the baboons?\n(f) \"...the lights stood up to the onslaught.. What figure of speech is contained in the expression above?\n(g) \"...guests at the new tourist hotel at Victoria Falls...\" i) What grammatical name is given to this expression as it is used in the passage? ii) What is its function?\n(h)or each of the following words, find another word or phrase which means the same and which can replace it as it is used in the passage: (i) magnificent; (ii) culprits: (iii) entreated; (iv) drastic; (v) conflict; (vi) gloomily.",

It is an asset as well as a menace to society. Like many things in this world, it has its good and bad sides. Even though it has its bad sides, no society can shut it down and thrive.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The press has its aims and objectives which it follows, come what may. Anyone who wants to be abreast of current affairs or notable events in his society must resort to reading printed material, apart from watching the television. In fact, the press serves more people than the electronic media do. Newspapers and periodicals go where the television cannot. Printed material goes even to the remotest areas of a country.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Institutions of learning disseminate information. However, not all cities, towns and villages have these institutions, but the print media can be used to disseminate information to people in these areas.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Governments, institutions and organizations have their policies, programmes and activities for the smooth running of their affairs. At times, only those in authority reap the benefits. Subordinates are often afraid to criticize the authorities. Their best bet is to resort to the print media which become their mouthpiece. Thus. what the oppressed cannot do, the print media do without fear or favour.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The press is also at the beck and call of anybody who wants its services. Many a time one sees people going job-hunting. They roam the streets of cities and towns, go from one office to the other, move from one employing authority to another only to be told that vacancies do not exist. To be candid, they do not need to waste such time and energy seeking jobs. All they need to do is comb the advertisement columns of newspapers and periodicals and they will be informed about available jobs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the press can be a nuisance in a society. How many times have we not found newspapers and periodicals publishing false and unauthenticated stories? Such stories spread like wild fire. They stir trouble and bring about disunity in societies. The publishers are often out to enrich themselves by churning out false information. For some newspapers and periodicals, reckless and dangerous gossip is their stock-in-trade.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No one can deny the fact that moral decadence has gripped our present world. It is true that even adults contribute to this menace in our societies. Many of our children and youths go for that which is morally low. However, the truth is that the press contributes, to a very large extent, to the loss of morality in our societies. There are publishers who specialize in the production of pornographic material which even our children and youths can afford to buy.\n\u00a0\u00a0Publishers of newspapers therefore should constantly be conscious of their crucial roles in the society and should always strive to use the medium for the promotion of peace, orderliness, progress and prosperity and not for negative or destructive ends.\n(a) In four sentences, one for each, state four positive roles of the press according to the writer.\n(b) In two sentences, one for each, state two negative roles of the press.",
