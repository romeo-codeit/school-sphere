    "explanation": "When a positively charged rod X\u00a0is brought near an uncharged metal sphere Y, it induces a separation of charges. The side of the sphere near the rod becomes negatively charged as electrons are attracted to it, while the far side becomes positively charged.\nWhen the finger touches the sphere, electrons can flow from the finger into the sphere, giving it an excess of electrons. After removing the finger and the rod, the sphere retains anegative charge.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

A moving body keeps moving not because of its inertia but only because of the absence of a force to slow it down, change its course, or speed it up.There are two numerical measures of the inertia of a body: its mass, which governs its resistance to the action of a force, and its moment of inertia about a specified axis, which measures its resistance to the action of a torque about the same axis.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

The reciprocal of the viscosity is called the fluidity, a measure of the ease of flow. Molasses, for example, has a greater viscosity than water. Because part of a fluid that is forced to move carries along to some extent adjacent parts, viscosity may be thought of as internal friction between the molecules; such friction opposes the development of velocity differences within a fluid. Viscosity is a major factor in determining the forces that must be overcome when fluids are used in lubrication and transported in pipelines.

The lower the current, the lower the resistance losses in the conductors. And when resistance losses are low, energy losses are low also.
