    "correct_answer": "Tradition plays a very significant role in the relationship between Pokuwaa and her mother. Being the only daughter among the five sons of her mother, the old woman tends to be closer to her than her sons. By tradition of matrilineal inheritance, the offspring of sons belong to the families of the sons' wives. So, although Pokuwaa has brothers, who have children, it is to Pokuwaa that her mother looks for her grandchildren, properly so called. Because of this the old woman takes keen interest in Pokuwaa's affairs, especially her search for a child.\nBeing old and a custodian of their traditional beliefs, she supervises the offering to the river and the god of Tano. This is what the priest says will open the way for Pokuwaa to get a child. Pokuwaa goes along well enough and her mother takes care of her interest and is watchful that she does not come to harm through ignorance. When Pokuwaa deprives the eagle of its meal at the Ananse stream on a taboo day and brings the hornbill home, her mother sees disaster looming for Pokuwaa. Quickly she arranges the necessary purification for Pokuwaa. If Pokuwaa dies now, how will her mother get a grandchild? This is a serious matter for the old woman.\nIt is evident that Pokuwaa's mother's involvement in the affairs of her daughter is deep. She closely directs Pokuwaa's observance of the rites concerning Pokuwaa's search for a child. She keeps her daughter alert to her responsibilities to Tano.\nAll along, however, Pokuwaa seems to have ideas of her own. She is obedient to the directives of her mother and the priest. Somehow, she looks higher up the ladder to Almighty Onyankopon. When things seem to be taking too long to happen, she feels frustrated She simply repudiates Tano and devotes herself direct to Onyankopon in her own manner.\nThe revelation of Pokuwaa's decision to reject Tano has a shattering effect on her mother. For the older woman, it is unthinkable to do what Pokuwaa does. She reports the matter to the head of the clan, Opanin Kofi Owusu, whose assurances that things will work out do no convince her. She sobs for a doomed state whose women refuse to bear children. If can be seen also that more seriously, she laments because she will not get a grandchild if Pokuwaa does not bear a child.\nThere is much natural motherly love borne towards Pokuwaa by her mother. Driving this love appears to be the expectation of an old woman who wants to count her grandchildren in her final days on earth, and be assured of their tears when she dies. Pokuwaa's mother does not hide her ardent desire and this urges her into getting very deeply involved in her daughter's affairs.",

    "correct_answer": "Tano Kofi seems to occupy a central position in the small village of Brenhoma. Although it is not the highest God - Nyankopon Twedeampong - its activities as a god are observed throughout the story. This is so because the people are traditionalists and highly superstitious.There are seventy-seven other lesser gods, but the great Tano's name is mentioned with awe, He seems to be the founding god of Brenhoma as the Asafo captain calls his people in his song during the search for Yaw Boakye. Tano is a uniting force and a custodian of the welfare of the people.This is evident in the way the people throng to his shrine for consultation and sacrifice. The haste and excitement displayed by Pokuwaa at the beginning of the novel show that the shrine is no doubt a melting point where people go to either put their requests forward to the great Tano or to offer thanks.\nThis is why we meet Pokuwaa making frantic efforts to look for the lost jet-black hen which she has been asked-to present at Tanofie on the day of sacrifice.\u00a0Pokuwaa's friend, Koramoa, has had a baby boy through the intervention of great god Tano and that is why every Fofie, she goes there and dances to the beat of the drumming.\nIn their routine prayer during the Odwira festival the name of Tano and the seventy-seven gods are invoked to bring healing, blessing and happiness to the people. This is the activity we see Pokuwaa engaged in through a good part of the novel until she gets fed up with the practice and stops.Because of the respect accorded to this god by the people. Pokuwaa's decision to discontinue following the directives recommended by the Tano priest is not taken lightly by her mother. Pokuwaa's decision angers her and prompts the Old Lady to report Pokuwaa to the head of the Asona Clan, Opanyin Kofi Owusu. When Pokuwaa discontinues making sacrifices to the god Tano, her mother continues to make the sacrifices.\nWhen Pokuwaa eventually becomes pregnant, Kwadwo and her mother attribute the pregnancy to the great god Tano. It is therefore obvious that for the people of Brenhoma, no good thing happens without being attributed to the god Tano.",

Piggy reveals to Ralph in this first encounter that he has been wearing spectacles since he was three. In many respects Piggy is both physically and health-wise a weak boy. He has asthma so he has been warned by his guardian not to run; and he wears spectacles because he has sight challenges.\nPiggy's glasses are one of the symbols in the novel which are significant to the meaning of the novel. Apart from the conch, the glasses appear to be the next most significant symbol which bear directly on the survival strategies of the boys. After the boys have settled on the issue of the need to have a Chief and the use of the conch as a symbol of authority, the next challenge confronting them is the issue of rescue. This challenge is projected to be addressed by setting up a fire on top of the mountain. Piggy's glasses becomes the useful tool to light the pile of wood for this purpose. Jack instantly points to the glasses and there is a general agreement by the boys. Both Jac and Ralph jointly use the glasses to light the fire.\nThe general enthusiasm which greets the setting up of the fire is shortlived as Jack and his group fail to watch over it.

However, Ralph leads Piggy and Samneric to re-light the fire. Again Piggy's glasses are used to reenliven the boys' rescue attempts.

Here the glasses are significant in two respects. First is their importance to the tribe. The hunters realize once again that much of their survival depends on having a fire with which they can roast meat and light their part of the island. Second is its significance to the plot. The event of stealing the glasses signifies the beginning of the events that culminate in the final peace and order on the island. Piggy's glasses are partially broken at this point. The attempt to recover the glasses leads to the climax of the story. Jack captures Samneric and engages Ralph in a physical fight.

He therefore sails far out to sea, equipped with sardines and two baits wrapped in a newspaper. The old man works hard and long. Eventually he catches a big fish. In his loneliness Santiago has a bird for company.Santiago knows it is a big fish because of its weight. The old man moves with the fish for a number of days.

He makes calculations of the monetary worth of the fish. \"He is my fortune\", he thinks. He cannot believe the size of his fish. His mental calculation pegs the weight of the fish at fifteen hundred pounds, maybe more. It would bring the highest price on the market, which is enough to compensate for all the toil and ill luck of former times and trips.\nFortunately, the winds rise and begging to drive the boat towards the coast. He is homeward bound with a successful catch. But the old man has not reckoned with the sharks which begin to eat the fish. He kills several of them but they came in a pack. He fights hard and bravely, but the sharks are one too many. Besides, he has no weapon to fight with. \"Nothing\", he says aloud, \"I went too far\". By the time he reaches the shore, there is nothing left of the huge fish which measures 'eighteen feet from the nose to tail'. The old man is completely exhausted physically.

    "correct_answer": "The lion on the beach of Africa appear as a significant symbol in the Old Man and the Sea. Santiago, the protagonist of the story, dreams about them three times in the novel. Each of the times the lions appear in Santiago's dreams\u00a0they are portrayed as key to the life of the old man and the plot of the story especially this sojourn in Cassablance and his heroic hand wrestling victory over the negro of Cienfuegos.\nFirst, Santiago dreams about the lions as he departs on his three-day fishing expedition. They appear as ordinary cubs and play like young cats in the dusk. Santiago here sees a similarity betwen the cubs and his boy, Manolin. He loves them as he loves Manolin because they are youthful like Manolin who seems to him a sign of great things to come, The image of the lions is also significant in Santiago's dream about them because they always make him, like Manolin, happy; they are also good company to him because he sees them in the image of his apprentice.\nSecondly, the lions appear in Santiago's dream as he sleeps on the boat for few hours during his battle with the ferocious fish, the marlin. This time the lions appear as adults. In their majesty, the lions suggest great strength and honour, providing Santiago with inspiration, a nobility of purpose, and a sense of vitality that keeps him on toward his ambition. They are therefore significant in Santiago's dream because they provide him with inspiration and belief in himself and urge him to be hopeful in hi adventure.\nIn addition, the lions are significant to the story because often, the old man almost simultaneously dreams about them as he reams about Manolin. Whenever the boy appears in Santiago's thoughts, he is depicted as exerting himself and proving his worth. Whenever Santiago thinks about the lions, he relaxes because they appear in his imagination to be in control and thus, inspire him to have confidence in himself.\nFinally, the lions appear in Santiago's dream at the very end of the stroy. Their significance at a time that the old man appears to have been finally defeated is that there are still promises of regeneration and renewal, particularly because Manolin also comes into the picture to rescue his master.\nThe sombre atmosphere at the end of the novel is reinforced by the final image of the lions to suggest the interplay of destruction and renewal in the story of the protagonist.",

    "correct_answer": "Romantic love is a predominant theme in the play. But this is welded into a compact whole with the theme of war. In the play, the experiences of the characters show that the romance of war is closely connected to the romance of love.\nAs the play opens, the audience is introduced to Raina's romantic perceptions of love. She is a pretty, yound lady whose reading of two poets, Byron and Pushkin, has impacted her idea of love. Standing on the balcony of her bedroom, she admires the beauty of the night, dreams of her fiance, Sergius, who is currently fighting in the war between Bulgaria and Serbia. Raina, in ecstasy, receives the news of her fiance's bravery on the war front from her mother and in her bedroom, adores her lover's photograph affectionately. She feels that she has beenk, before now, a \"prosaic little coward\" in her doubts about Sergius herosim. Thus, her lover's supposed heroic performance feeds into her romantic perceptions of love. Raina glorifies Sergius as a here. On returning from the war, a \"higher love\" develops between them. Sergius calls her \"My queen\" and \"goddess\" and she calls him her \"king\" and \"hero\". They glorify each other because they are blind to their own failings. Later, both of them have to face the realities of love and submit to their own common human imperfections.\nThis idealized world of romantic love is contrasted with Bluntschli's blunt but realistic perception of both love and war. The fugitive is used to voice the playwright's position on the issue of love. He shocks Raina presenting a realistic view of Sergius' foolhardiness on the war front.\nThe fault in Raina and Sergius' perceptions of love is further brought to the fore as we see them cheating or each other, Raina flirting with Bluntschli behind Sergius' back and sergius flirting with Louka behind Raina's back. Their romantic love is therefore treated as something that cannot last.\nThrough Bluntschli and Louka, the playwright is able to focus the searchlight of truth and reason on the idea of love. Bluntschli and Louka are intellectually superior to Sergius and Raina in this play. The futility c: raomantic love is stressed when Nicola is forced to give up on Louka for business and profit, and Louka for\u00a0social status.

Bluntschli is, however, a Swiss mercenary on the side of the Serbs Running away from the battlefield after an unprofessional chivalry charge led by Sergius which destabilizes the Serbian army, Bluntschli takes refuge in Raina's chamber. Even though Sergius acknowledges Bluntschli's professional qualities while recalling the last battle before the end of the war, he never realizes until later, that his lover, Raina, Major Petkoff's, daughter is the one who shelters him and helps him to escape. The grounds for a conflict between the two soldiers are being established through Raina's amorous feeling for Bluntschli, in spite of her romantic idealization of Sergius.\nHowever, Rains, in the early part of the play, expresses her scepticism about Sergius' heroism. She tells Catherine, her mother, \"Our ideals of what Sergius would do - our partiotism - our heroic ideals. I sometimes used to doubt whether they were anything but dreams\". Thus, it seems this scepticism is proved right when she meets Bluntschli. Bluntschli demonstrates the reality about war and warring to her as she shields the \"chocolate-cream soldier\". She later rebukes Sergius' \"coarse\" retelling of Bluntschli's escape story in her presence. Bluntschli has apparently related his escape to the Bulgarian army during the exchange of soldiers after the ceasefire.\nLouka's revelations about Raina's secret love escapades to Sergius provides the necessary reasons for his later challenge to Bluntschli. In the third Act, the stage direction portrays Sergius as admirably envious of B Iuntschli as the latter works to map out the disengagement of three cavalry regiments to Philippopolis. Sergius contemplates \"Bluntschli's quick, sure, business-like progress with a mixture of envious imitation at his own incapacity\". The impression given in this regard is that in spite of the initial lack of kinowledge about the identity of his rival, Sergius is already nursing a grudge against Bluntsehii. The revelation of Bluntschli as the man who has won over Raina's love, which Sergius uses as excuses for challenging him is only being underscored by the growing envy which Sergius has already nursed against Bluntschli. The conflict bewtween these two is not, therefore, rooted in Raina's switch over to Bluntschli but on the personality crisis Sergius has.\nThe path to the resolution of the conflict begins to emerge as Bluntschli reappears to return Major Petkoff's coat given to him by Raina to prevent himself from being identified as the tensions and apprehensions that the audience has been put to begin to reach the climax. This also shows how the story of the two men forms a sub plot in the play and the conflict between them a sub confilict of the overall conflict in the play. Bluntschli appears on the scene only to be challenged to a duel by Sergious even though he (Sergius) does not state the grounds for the challenge. Yet, Bluntschli accepts the challenge to fight him without any demand for his offence.

The emphasis is on the activity and it seems he is enjoying himself immensely as the swing moves \" faster and faster\".\nMore gets known about the boy as the poem progresses. Reference is made to his \"blue shirt\" billowing \"in the breeze\", and its comparison with \"a tattered kite\".

    "answer_url": "https://myschool.ng/classroom/literature-in-english/52629?exam_type=waec&type=theory&page=19",
    "correct_answer": "The poet presents an image of a world before colonialism which brought great devastation. The dominant image is that of commerce: \"We had traded in this market competitively perfect\", suggesting peace.\nThe picture changes dramatically, however, when colonization sets in to disrupt the erstwhile peaceful co-existence. The metaphor of \"cut our ribs, dried our cows\" and \"burst the cowshed\" presents a picture of devastation affecting agriculture and the economy which have been the bulwark of the people's prosperity. The very natural environment is not spared by the reference to words like \"drought\" and \"famine\". The blackman's confidence is thus crowded as he is cut off from his means of livelihood.\nAfter presenting such a grim picture of life after colonialism the poet enters into a state of personal lamentation. This is captured by the hyperbole in \"my tears flowed to flooded streams\", while the allusion to Sodom and Gomorrah presages the complete penury into which the poet has sunk. The image of the debtors and creditors at \"my rusty door\" is poignant. He has become the laughing stock of others as what is left of his miserable possessions is auctioned. The devastation brought in by colonialism is total and the poet's own life becomes a veritable testament.",

    "correct_answer": "The Sunne Rising is a dramatization of an imagined confrontation between a lover and the sun. Initially, the poet feigns a foul and angry mood, as the sun shines into the room where he and his mistress are still lying in bed. He not only describes the sun as \"busy\" and \"unruly\" but also calls the sun a \"fool\". The poet directs the sun to its routine rounds - \"goe chide late schoole boyes, and sowre prentices... \" etc. admonishing it to do its job and not annoy him. All this occurs in the first stanza.\nIn the second stanza, the poet's stance appears to soften as he acknowledges the power of the sun's rays. He trivializes it and boasts that he could \"eclipse\" it \"with a wink\". In this, there is both arrogance and sarcasm.\nThe boast continues in the third stanza where he presents his lover as perfection itself. For both of them are an embodiment of royalty and all the riches of the world. The mood here is triumphant. Suddenly (still in the third stanza) the poet's mood becomes conciliatory and amiable. He sees the sun as aging and requiring rest, yet having his work to do. The poet's anger seems to have cooled off considerably. He asks the sun to shine on him and his lover. He is obviously proud that, after all, the best place for the sun to do his job, if he is to do it well, is the closet/room where the lovers are, for that epitomizes the vast world round which the sun must travel daily. This, the poet contends, will ease the suns' burden though he will have fully accomplished his task by simply staying with the lovers. The mood at this point, besides being conciliatory, is also patronizing.\nIt can be said that the initially angry mood of the poet changes to become persuasive, then conciliatory and patronizing.",
