    "correct_answer": "The following are five ways that citizens can demonstrate political apathy:\n1. Low Voter Turnout: Citizens may choose not to participate in elections, resulting in low voter turnout. This is a clear sign of political apathy as it indicates a lack of interest in the electoral process and the outcomes of elections.2. Non-Participation in Political Discussions: Avoiding political conversations or debates, whether in person or online, can be a sign of political apathy. These citizens may feel indifferent or uninterested in political matters and refrain from engaging in such discussions.\n3. Ignoring Political News:\u00a0Citizens may demonstrate political apathy by not following political news or current events. They might avoid reading newspapers, watching news channels, or staying updated with political developments.\n4. Lack of Involvement in Civic Activities: Political apathy can be seen when citizens do not engage in civic activities such as joining community groups, attending town hall meetings, or participating in public demonstrations and protests.\n5. Disinterest in Contacting Representatives: Citizens showing political apathy may avoid reaching out to their elected representatives to voice their concerns, provide feedback, or seek assistance with political issues. They may feel that their input will not make a difference.\nThe following are five reasons for political apathy:\n1. Distrust in the Political System: Many citizens may believe that the political system is corrupt, inefficient\u00a0or unresponsive to their needs. This distrust can lead to a sense of hopelessness and apathy, as they feel their participation will not lead to meaningful change.\n2. Lack of Education and Awareness:\u00a0A lack of political education and awareness can contribute to apathy. Citizens who are not well-informed about political processes, issues\u00a0and the importance of their participation may be less likely to engage in political activities.\n3. Disillusionment with Politicians: Past experiences of unfulfilled promises and perceived self-serving behaviour by politicians can lead to disillusionment. When citizens feel that politicians do not act in the public interest, they may become apathetic and disengaged.\n4. Economic Hardships: Citizens facing economic difficulties might prioritise their immediate personal and financial concerns over political participation. They may feel that their time and energy are better spent addressing their own survival needs rather than engaging in politics.\n5. Perceived Lack of Impact*\u00a0Some citizens may believe that their individual vote or participation does not make a significant difference in the larger political landscape. This perceived lack of impact can demotivate them from engaging in political activities, leading to apathy.",
