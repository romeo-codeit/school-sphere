In Nigeria, where democracy is still evolving, the media ensures accountability, transparency\u00a0and citizen participation in governance. Here are five key ways the media contributes to making democratic government work in Nigeria:\n1. Promoting Transparency and Accountability\nThe media serves as awatchdog, exposing corruption, mismanagement, and abuse of power by government officials. Investigative journalism helps to hold public officeholders accountable, ensuring that government actions align with the public interest. For example, media coverage of financial scandals and electoral malpractice pressures leaders to act responsibly.\n2. Educating and Informing Citizens\nA well-informed electorate is essential for a functioning democracy. The media providesaccurate and up-to-date informationabout government policies, political developments, and civic responsibilities. By explaining complex policies in simple terms, the media helps citizens make informed decisions, especially during elections.\n3. Providing a Platform for Public Debate and Participation\nThe media creates avenues forpublic discourse, where citizens can express their views on governance, social issues, and policy decisions. Platforms like radio talk shows, TV discussions, social media, and newspapers enable Nigerians to engage in meaningful conversations about national issues, strengthening democratic participation.\n4. Acting as a Bridge Between the Government and the People\nThe media plays a vital role incommunicating government policiesto the people and relaying public opinions to the government. Through interviews, press conferences, and policy analysis, the media ensures that both government officials and citizens understand each other's concerns, fostering a responsive and people-oriented government.\n5. Monitoring Elections and Democratic Processes\nA democratic government relies onfree, fair, and credible elections. The media plays a crucial role in covering election campaigns, reporting election irregularities, and providing real-time updates on voting processes. By acting as an independent observer, the media helps to prevent electoral fraud and strengthens public confidence in the democratic process.",

    "correct_answer": "Five Reasons Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) Are Major Stakeholders in Nigeria\u2019s Governance Structure\nCivil Society Organisations (CSOs) help to promote democracy, good governance and national development in Nigeria. As independent, non-governmental entities, they help to bridge the gap between the government and the people. Here are five key reasons why CSOs are considered major stakeholders in Nigeria\u2019s governance structure:\n1. Promoting Transparency and Accountability\nCSOs serve aswatchdogs, monitoring government actions and policies to ensure transparency and accountability. They expose corruption, demand good governance, and push for reforms that promote efficiency and fairness in public administration. For example, organisations like theSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP)have consistently challenged cases of financial mismanagement in Nigeria.\n2. Advocating for Human Rights and Social Justice\nCSOs play a critical role in protectinghuman rights and social justiceby defending the rights of marginalized groups, women, children, and persons with disabilities. They challenge human rights violations, campaign for legal reforms, and offer support to victims of injustice. Groups likeAmnesty International Nigeriaand theCLEEN Foundationadvocate for police reforms and justice for victims of abuse.\n3. Enhancing Citizen Participation in Governance\nCSOs empower citizens to engage in governance byeducating them on their rights, responsibilities, and civic duties. They organize town hall meetings, voter education campaigns, and public debates to ensure citizens participate actively in decision-making processes. This strengthens democracy and ensures that government policies reflect the people's interests.\n4. Providing Alternative Policy Ideas and Solutions\nCSOs conduct research, propose policies, and engage in advocacy to improve governance and national development. They provideindependent, well-researched alternatives to government policies, helping policymakers make informed decisions. Think tanks like theCentre for Democracy and Development (CDD)andBudgIT Nigeriaanalyse government budgets and policies, offering solutions to improve economic and social governance.\n5. Supporting Social and Economic Development\nMany CSOs focus on community development by providinghealthcare, education, poverty alleviation programs, and humanitarian aid. They complement government efforts in sectors where public services are insufficient or inefficient. Organisations likeActionAid Nigeriaand theRed Cross Society of Nigeriaprovide relief aid, empower women, and support rural development.",

Several factors contribute to these challenges. Below are five key reasons:\n1. Weak Democratic Institutions\nMany ECOWAS states struggle withfragile democratic institutions, such as weak judicial systems, compromised electoral commissions, and ineffective parliaments. These institutions often fail to uphold democratic principles, allowingelection rigging, judicial manipulation, and constitutional amendments that favour incumbents. When institutions fail to function effectively, it creates a breeding ground for political instability and unconstitutional power grabs.\n2. Corruption and Poor Governance\nWidespreadcorruptionandmismanagement of resourcesweaken public trust in democratic governments. When leadersembezzle public funds, fail to provide basic services, and enrich themselves at the expense of citizens, the frustration often leads to civil unrest. In some cases, military interventions or violent protests emerge as a response to corrupt civilian rule, as seen in Guinea and Mali.\n3. Electoral Fraud and Manipulation\nMany ECOWAS states experienceelections that lack credibility, with widespread allegations of voter suppression, ballot box stuffing, and post-election violence. When political leadersrefuse to accept defeat, manipulate constitutions to extend their tenure, or silence opposition parties, democracy is weakened. The loss of faith in the electoral process has led to military takeovers in countries like Niger and Burkina Faso.\n4. Rising Insecurity and Terrorism\nWest Africa faces significant security threats fromterrorist groups, armed insurgencies, and banditry. When democratic governmentsfail to address security challenges, people begin to see the military as a better alternative for restoring order. In countries like Mali and Burkina Faso, repeatedterrorist attacksandgovernment inactionled to public support for military interventions, undermining democratic governance.\n5. Foreign Influence and Geopolitical Interests\nExternal actors, includingforeign powers and regional blocs, play a role in shaping political events in ECOWAS states. Someformer colonial powershave been accused of supporting certain regimes for economic and strategic interests, while othersimpose sanctionsthat further destabilize governments. Additionally, military regimes sometimes receivesupport from neighbouring juntas, making democratic restoration difficult.",
