    "explanation": "To evaluate the expression \\( \\log_{\\sqrt{2}} 4 + \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}} 16 - \\log_{4} 32 \\), we can simplify each term separately.\n1. Calculate \\( \\log_{\\sqrt{2}} 4 \\)\\(\\log_{\\sqrt{2}} 4 = \\frac{\\log_2 4}{\\log_2 \\sqrt{2}}\\)We know that \\( \\log_2 4 = 2 \\) (since \\( 2^2 = 4 \\)) and \\( \\log_2 \\sqrt{2} = \\log_2 2^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).Thus,\\(log_{\\sqrt{2}} 4 = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 4\\)\n2. Calculate \\( \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}} 16 \\)\\(\\log_{\\frac{1}{2}} 16 = \\frac{\\log_2 16}{\\log_2 \\frac{1}{2}}\\)We know that \\( \\log_2 16 = 4 \\) (since \\( 2^4 = 16 \\)) and \\( \\log_2 \\frac{1}{2} = \\log_2 2^{-1} = -1 \\).Thus,\\(\\log_{\\frac{1}{2}} 16 = \\frac{4}{-1} = -4\\)\n3. Calculate \\( \\log_{4} 32 \\)\\(\\log_{4} 32 = \\frac{\\log_2 32}{\\log_2 4}\\)We know that \\( \\log_2 32 = 5 \\) (since \\( 2^5 = 32 \\)) and \\( \\log_2 4 = 2 \\).Thus,\\(\\log_{4} 32 = \\frac{5}{2}\\)\nNow, we can substitute these results back into the original expression:\\(\\log_{\\sqrt{2}} 4 + \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}} 16 - \\log_{4} 32 = 4 - 4 - \\frac{5}{2}\\)\nCalculating this gives:\\(4 - 4 - \\frac{5}{2} = 0 - \\frac{5}{2} = -\\frac{5}{2}\\)\nThus, the final result is:\\(-\\frac{5}{2}\\) = - 2.5",
