The two parties in the covenant could be equals or one could be superior to the other. The breach of the terms by any of the parties determines/terminates the covenant unless the other party forgoes its legal right and allows the covenant to subsist.\n(b) One of the conditions stipulated in the covenant was God's promise that Sarah would bear Abraham a son in his old age (to be called Isaac). Although Abraham expressed a doubt (owing to his old age and the age of his \"barren\" wife), God assured him of his faithfulness. Then Abraham suggested that Ishmael might be the vehicle for God's fulfillment of the covenant. `No', said God. Sarah would bear a son with whom the covenant would be established with his descendants for\u00a0ever. As for Ishmael, God would bless him with children, but Sarah's son, Isaac, would surely be born at that season the following year. Soon after this, she conceived and bore a son. Abraham called his name 'Isaac' and circumcised him on the eighth day. Abraham was 100 years old then. Sarah said that God had made laughter of her.

Abner made himself stronger as he retained the leadership of Saul's army. lshboshet later accused Abner of having gone in to his father's concubine (Rizpah). This irked Abner and he asked whether he had become a dog's head as to be insulted on a matter concerning a woman. He openly defied lshboshet by telling him that he would renounce his allegiance to Saul's house and transfer same to David. Ishboshet was too weak to react to Abner's threat for he feared Abner. Abner however, sent messengers to David.\nHe asked him to enter into a covenant with him and he would hand over all Israel to him. David said he would consider his offer (see his face) if only he should restore his first wife, Michal. Saul's daughter, to him, after he had suffered so much to get her betrothed to him. David even sent the same order td Ishboshet to restore Michal to him and he had no choice but to comply. Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and called upon them to demonstrate their desire to make David king of all Israel (as God had destined it). With a delegation (of twenty men), he went to David in Hebron and David received thew warmly. Abner assured David that he would gather all Israel to enter into a covenant with him to reign over them.

He said, though, he, Solomon. was but a little child, he was in the midst of God's chosen people, a great people that cannot be numbered. He therefore asked for an understanding mind and wisdom, to govern the people and discern between good and evil ir governance. God was pleased with his request and he told him that since he had not asked for long life, riches, or the life of his enemies, he would grant him his request (such that none before or after him could be like him).

Christ taught them not to swear at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God; nor by the earth, for it is God's footstool or by Jerusalem, the city of the great king/God.

    "correct_answer": "(a) Paul admonishes everybody to subject themselves to the governing authorities, for God Himself permits all authorities. He asserts that those that exist are either authorized or permitted by God to operate. Therefore, anybody who resists the authorities is resisting God and will incure this judgement, for leaders are not appointed to be a terror to good conduct but to bad conduct. If any one is to avoid being afraid of authorities, he must do what is good and right, then he will receive approval from the authority for he is God's servant for His goal. However, if one does wrong, then one will be afraid, for the authority does not wield the sword in vain. He is the servant of God to execute God's wrath on the wrong doer. Therefore, every one must be subject to civil authority to avoid God's wrath. For the sake of conscience, they should pay respect to whom it is due and honour to whom honour is due.\n(b) To help authorities maintain law and order in schools, the following steps must be taken into consideration:\n(i) Obeying all laws and regulations of the school;\n(ii)Applying oneself fully to school work, studies and games including extra-curricula activities;\n(iii) Paying of fees as and when due;\n(iv) Being regular and punctual at all times;\n(v)Avoiding cult activities;\n(vi)Avoiding all forms of cheating, examination malpractices and stealing/pilferings;\n(vii) Being neat and tidy (in body and soul).",

    "correct_answer": "(a) Paul appealed to the Philippians to live a life worthy of the gospel (of Christ) which makes for good relationship among Christians. Such a life is built on love, affection and sympathy for one another. Christians should, therefore, not do anything out of selfishness or conceit, but, in humility they should count others better than themselves. Nobody should look only for his own selfish interests, but, everybody should also be concerned with others' interest. They should always have the nature of Christ in mind who, though was divine, did not count equality with God but he emptied himself and took the form of a servant so that he was born in human likeness, humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross. This is a thing to be emulated by Christians. As a result of Christ's humility, God richly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above all other names; that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven, and on earth, every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord to the glory of God.\n(b) Christian manifestation of spirit of humility is as follows:\n(i) A Christian should not be proud but humble. He should ask for what he could do for the church of God rather than what he could gain thereby.\n(ii) With the hope of salvation as a motivation, a Christian should be a doer of the word and not a hearer only.\n(iii) A Christian should preach the word of God and thereby make converts into the kingdom of God.",

    "correct_answer": "(a)(1) Peter advised elders to look after God's flock with tender care. They should work not as being under any external constraint, but willingly; not with the desire to make material gains, but with the eagerness that comes from the heart; not with a presumptuous and domineering spirit but as examples to be copied by the flock, so that at the appropriate time, they might attain the crown of glory.\n(ii) Peter advised the young ones to be in humble subjection to the leaders, for God humiliates the proud and exalts the humble. However, for both young and old, Peter recommends the humble approach. They should leave all cases of anxiety in the able hands of God. They should, in all soberness, be vigilant against the temptation of the devil who is always around to lead the spiritually weak ones to destruction in hell. Armed with patient faith, they should remember that suffering is part of their Christian calling, knowing that suffering will lead to glory in Christ who has eternal dominion.\n(b)The duties of a good church leader are:\n(i) His first concern should be the spiritual and physical well being of the flock.\n(ii) He must adjust his life as to practically show that he lives modestly.\n(iii) He should be a shining example to the congregation.\n(iv) He should encourage evangelism.\n(v) He should pray for the congregation and intercede on their behalf.\n(vi) He should give them spiritual counsel and moral courage.",

    "correct_answer": "James began his exposition on faith and works by calling upon Christians to be doers of the word and not deceive themselves as men of faith by not doing what they profess, for if they are mere hearers, they are like a man who observes his face in a mirror, but as soon as he goes away, forgets what his face looks like. He who has heard the perfect law, the gospel of Christ (which liberates us from the curse of the law) and perseveres in it by his actions, shall be blessed in his doing. For somebody to be truly religious, he must bridle his tongue or else his religion is in vain and he is deceiving himself. Pure and undiluted religion involves visiting orphans/widows (in their affliction)and keeping away from the stain of sin.\nTo butress his teaching, James cited the biblical instances of faith and works operating in unison. He spoke about Abraham's justification not merely because of his faith, but for matching his faith with requisite work. When he heard and obeyed God and showed his readiness to sacrifice his son-Isaac, he proved that his faith would have been incomplete without taking the appropriate action. Abraham believed God and it was reckoned for him as righteousness. Consequently, he was called the friend of God, having been justified by his works, and not by faith alone.\nAgain, Rahab had faith in the God of Israel and proved it by receiving God's messengers. She then deceived even her own people who came to capture and to slay the messengers by sending them on a wild goose chase and ensuring the escape of the messengers and was thus justified by her actions. In conclusion, James said that as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so faith apart from works is dead.",
