    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Glomerulus-Bowman's capsule-convoluted tubules-Henle's loop-convoluted tubules-collecting tubules.\nThis sequence accurately reflects the path that urea and other waste products take during urine formation.\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the correct sequence of urea movement during urine formation:\n1.Glomerulus: The journey of urea begins in the glomerulus, a cluster of tiny blood vessels in the kidney. Here, the blood is filtered, and urea, a waste product, passes through the glomerular filter into the nephron.\n2.Bowman's capsule: The filtered blood, including urea, collects in the Bowman's capsule, a cup-like structure surrounding the glomerulus.\n3.Convoluted tubules(proximal): From the Bowman's capsule, the filtrate (including urea) flows into the convoluted tubules. Here, some reabsorption and secretion occur, helping to regulate the amount of urea in the urine.\n4.Henle's loop: The filtrate then passes through Henle's loop, a U-shaped structure that helps concentrate the urine. Water and electrolytes are reabsorbed, increasing the concentration of urea.\n5.Convoluted tubules (Distal):The concentrated urea then enters the distal convoluted tubule, where further reabsorption occurs.\n6.Collecting tubules: Finally, the concentrated urine, containing urea, flows into the collecting tubules. Here, the final adjustments to the urine are made, and it is transported to the renal pelvis, then to the bladder, and eventually excreted.\nThe other options are incorrect and do not accurately reflect the sequence of urine formation.",
