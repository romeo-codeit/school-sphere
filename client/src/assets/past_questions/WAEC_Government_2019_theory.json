    "options": {},
    "answer_url": "https://myschool.ng/classroom/government/57709?exam_type=waec&type=theory&page=69",
    "correct_answer": "(a) The following are some of the problems confronting Nigerian Federalism:\n(i)Problem of Acceptable Revenue Allocation Formula:The allocation of revenue among the different levels of government in Nigeria has been a contentious issue. The debate centres around the appropriate formula for distributing national revenue to ensure fairness\u00a0among the federal, state and local governments. Disagreements over revenue sharing often lead to conflicts and accusations of favouritism.\n(ii)Over-concentration of Powers at the Centre:The federal system in Nigeria has historically seen a significant concentration of powers at the federal level. This centralisation limits the autonomy of state and local governments and reduces\u00a0their ability to effectively manage local affairs. The over-centralisation of power often leads to inefficiencies\u00a0as the federal government may be too far removed from local issues to address them effectively.\n(iii)Ethnicity and Tribalism:Nigeria is a diverse country with numerous ethnic groups, and ethnic and tribal loyalties often influence political decisions and alignments. This diversity can lead to ethnic tensions and conflicts especially when some groups are unfairly treated. Ethnicity and tribalism can undermine national unity and make it difficult to develop a cohesive national identity.\n(iv)Fear of Majority Domination:Smaller ethnic groups often fear domination by larger ethnic groups, particularly in political and economic spheres. This fear can lead to resistance against central policies and increase demands for greater autonomy or even secession. The fear of majority domination exacerbates ethnic tensions and poses a threat to national unity.\n(v)Threat to National Unity/Integration:The combination of ethnic diversity, unequal resource distribution and political centralisation can threaten national unity and integration. Regional differences and feelings of marginalisation among certain groups can lead to calls for secession or increased autonomy and this can pose\u00a0a significant challenge to maintaining a united and stable nation.\n(b) The following are features of Nigeria's Federalism:\n(i)Division of Powers between the Centre\u00a0and Component Units:In Nigeria's federal system, powers are divided between the federal, state and local governments. This division is outlined in the constitution, specifying which powers are exclusive to the federal government, which are concurrent (shared between federal and state governments), and which are residual (left to the local government). This structure is intended to allow for a balance of power and ensure that all levels of government can function effectively.\n(ii)Existence of a Written and Rigid Constitution:Nigeria operates under a written constitution that clearly defines the structure, powers and functions of the government. The Constitution is considered rigid because it requires a complex process to amend, involving both federal and state legislatures. This rigidity ensures stability and predictability in the governance system, though it can also make adapting to new challenges more difficult.\n(iii)Supremacy of the Constitution:The Constitution is the supreme law of the land in Nigeria. All laws and actions by the government must conform to the Constitution, and any law or action that contravenes the Constitution can be declared invalid by the courts. This principle ensures that the government operates within a legal framework and protects the\u00a0rights of the citizens.\n(iv)Existence of a Bicameral Legislature:Nigeria's federal system features a bicameral legislature at the federal level, consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate represents the states, with equal representation from each state, while the House of Representatives represents the population, with seats allocated based on population size. This structure aims to balance the interests of different regions and populations.\n(v)Existence of a Supreme Court:The Supreme Court of Nigeria is the highest judicial authority in the country. It has the power to interpret the Constitution and adjudicate disputes between the federal and state governments. The existence of the Supreme Court ensures that there is a final arbiter in legal and constitutional matters, maintaining the rule of law and the balance of power within the federal system.",
