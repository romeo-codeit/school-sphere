The speaker then responds to another character's query about the change in music, indicating that things have changed. Then, the speaker mentions that next month, the same Chief Jeunkoku is to face the music for sharing in a big loot, implying involvement in corruption.\nGiven this context, the first statement in the cartoon suggests that the speaker was participating in a celebration hosted by Chief Jeunkoku, who is later revealed to be corrupt. This means that the speaker is aiding and abetting corruption, as the speaker was involved in an event celebrating a corrupt individual without initially opposing or questioning it.",

    "explanation": "A way Chief Jeunkoku can evade sanction is if there is a weak and compromised judiciary.\nThe presence of checks and balances would make it more difficult for Chief Jeunkoku to evade sanction, as it ensures that no single branch of government has absolute power and can hold others accountable. The operational principle of the rule of law would also prevent Chief Jeunkoku from evading sanction, as it means that laws are applied fairly and equally to everyone. The supremacy of the constitution ensures that everyone, including Chief Jeunkoku, is subject to the highest law of the land, making it difficult to evade sanction.\nHowever, a weak and compromised judiciary would enable Chief Jeunkoku to evade sanction, as it implies that the judicial system is ineffective, corrupt or biased and this can allow\u00a0him to escape accountability for his actions.",
