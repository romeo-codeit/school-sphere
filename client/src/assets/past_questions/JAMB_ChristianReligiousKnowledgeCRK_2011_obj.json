I will be with you no more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.\u00a013Up, sanctify the people, and say, \u2018Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow;for thus says the\u00a0Lord, God of Israel, \u201cThere are devoted things in the midst of you, O Israel; you cannot stand before your enemies, until you take away the devoted things from among you.\u201d",
