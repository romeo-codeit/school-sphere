    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "1. First Reading: This is the initial stage of a bill's journey through Parliament. It involves the formal introduction of the bill to the Parliament. During this stage, there is no debate on the bill's content, and it is not typically scrutinized in detail.\n2. Second Reading: At this stage, the general principles and objectives of the bill are debated. Members of Parliament have the opportunity to discuss the bill's merits and raise any concerns they may have. A vote is usually taken at the end of the debate to determine whether the bill should proceed to the next stage.\n3. Committee Stage:\u00a0If the bill passes the Second Reading, it moves to the Committee stage. This is where the bill is examined in detail, clause by clause. The committee, which can be a standing committee or a specially appointed committee, considers amendments, debates specific provisions of the bill, and may call witnesses or experts for input.\n4. Report Stage:\u00a0After the Committee stage, the bill goes back to the full Parliament for the Report stage. During this stage, the committee reports its findings and any amendments made to the bill. Members of Parliament have the opportunity to further debate and propose additional amendments to the bill. Once all the amendments have been considered and voted on, the bill moves to the Third Reading.\n5. Third Reading: This is the final stage of the bill's passage through Parliament. At this stage, the bill is debated in its final form, and members decide whether to approve it or reject it. No further amendments can be made at this point. If the bill is approved, it proceeds to the other house of Parliament (if applicable) for a similar process.\nA bill reaches the Report stage after the Committee stage.",
