Under pressure from independence movements in the colonies, the government transferred a number of powers from\u00a0Paris\u00a0to elected territorial governments in French African colonies and also removed remaining voting inequalities by implementing universal suffrage and abolishing the multiple electoral college system. It was the first step in the creation of the\u00a0French Community, comparable to the British\u00a0Commonwealth of Nations. Most French African colonies held elections under the new universal suffrage Loi Cadre system on 31 March 1957, the exceptions being Cameroon which held its election on 23 December 1956, and Togo which held its election on 17 April 1958. (Cameroon and Togo were United Nations mandated territories and so were on a different trajectory than the rest of French Africa).",

Many African students in Britain found that, due to racism, it was difficult to secure satisfactory lodgings. While the Colonial Office showed some interest in establishing such a hostel, WASU was keen to maintain control of the project, and in 1929, Solanke left for a fundraising journey through West Africa. Despite this, the Colonial Office assembled a secret committee to plan for a hostel under its control, and attempted to secure private funding for its construction.",

Bellow are some other reasons;\n1) Grievence: this theory explains that coups are caused by groups that mobilize to fight injustices committed by the state. After a long history of political, economic, and social injustices, many groups begin to start coups to stop the trend of injustice.\n2) Greed: coups are started by groups of people who are tired of resource and other kinds of economic exploitation. Many leaders in Africa exploit their own land and people to extract valuable natural resource reserves, which eventually takes a toll on citizens. These citizens eventually start coups in hopes of attaining benefits of resources. (ex. Chad - many of Chad's coups have been started because of greed - stemming from exploitation of oil reserves in Chad)\n3) Colonial Effect: many scholars argue that the cause of coups in Africa stems from colonialism. Colonialism implemented an ideology across Africa that justified the attainment of power through force. Scholars believe that this lasting effect has contributed to the cause of coups around Africa.",
