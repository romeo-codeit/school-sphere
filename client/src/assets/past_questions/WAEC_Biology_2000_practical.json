(i)\u00a0Make a labeled drawing of 8 cm to 10cm long to show the observable\u00a0internal structures of specimen B.\n(ii) State the dispersal mechanism of specimen B.\n(C)(i) Identify\u00a0\u00a0C, D and E without reasons.\u00a0(ii) State two features, each of specimen C, D and E which adapt\u00a0\u00a0to\u00a0their habitats.\u00a0\n2. The height\u00a0(cm)\u00a0of 20 students in a class are as follows:.155, 157, 151 169, 162, 151, 149, 165, 169,176.169, 179,173,\u00a0179, 173, 169, 157, 155, 165, 157, 197 and 162.\nUse them to answer the following questions:\n(a) Make a frequency distribution table of class interval of five of the different heights\u00a0 (b) what is the modal height? (ii) median height?
