So, it is an effector organ.\nThe ear glands are also effector organs as they produce earwax in response to the nervous system.The cerumen(ear wax) help protect the ear canal by trapping dirts, bacteria\u00a0 and other small particles.\nConversely, the nose bridge is not an effector organ because it is only a structural part of the nose which provides support and shape. It doesn't have the ability to respond to stimulus from the nervous system or perform any specific function in response to stimuli.",
