I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the ongoing issue of the inadequate maintenance of public facilities, as highlighted in several recent articles in your esteemed newspaper. This matter is of great importance and warrants immediate attention from authorities, policymakers, and the general public alike.Public facilities, such as parks, roads, public transportation, and community centres, play a vital role in enhancing the quality of life for residents in our city. However, it is disheartening to witness the neglect and decay that many of these facilities are currently experiencing. This not only reflects poorly on our community's image but also has a tangible impact on the well-being and safety of citizens.The lack of proper maintenance not only leads to an unsightly environment but also poses various risks and inconveniences. Uneven sidewalks and poorly maintained roads are not only an eyesore but also jeopardize the safety of pedestrians and motorists. Parks and recreational areas, when left uncared for, discourage outdoor activities and contribute to a decline in community bonding and overall health.Furthermore, poorly maintained public facilities can hinder economic growth and development. Visitors and investors are likely to be deterred by the evident disregard for the upkeep of our city, affecting our local businesses and job opportunities.It is imperative for both government bodies and community members to take collective responsibility for addressing this issue. Adequate funding and efficient allocation of resources are essential to ensure that our public facilities receive the attention they require. Moreover, community engagement initiatives and volunteer efforts can significantly contribute to the upkeep and improvement of these spaces.\nI urge the relevant authorities to prioritize the maintenance of public facilities as an integral part of urban planning and development. This will not only enhance the quality of life for citizens but also instill a sense of pride and ownership in our community.I applaud your newspaper for bringing this issue to the forefront and sparking a much-needed discussion. I hope that the collective voice of concerned citizens can drive positive change and inspire policymakers to take immediate action.Thank you for your continued dedication to raising awareness about matters of public interest.Yours faithfully,Mumainat Kola.",

    "correct_answer": "In the bustling world of education, where academic pressures often take centre stage, it's easy to overlook the profound impact that extracurricular activities can have on a student's overall development. Activities clubs and societies, which were once vibrant hubs of creativity, camaraderie, and skill-building, have gradually faded into the background. However, it's time to reignite the spirit of these clubs and societies within our school walls, for they offer a myriad of benefits that extend beyond textbooks and classrooms.A Holistic Approach to EducationEducation extends beyond textbooks, and the resurgence of activities clubs and societies can inject a much-needed dose of holistic learning into our academic journey. These platforms provide students with an avenue to explore their passions, interests, and hidden talents, fostering a sense of individuality and self-awareness. Whether it's painting, drama, debate, robotics, or sports, these clubs offer an opportunity to diversify skills and gain experiences that can't be found within the confines of a classroom.Building Confidence and Leadership SkillsActive participation in clubs and societies bolsters confidence and nurtures leadership skills in students. Through organizing events, taking on responsibilities, and collaborating with peers, students learn to communicate effectively, manage their time efficiently, and lead with integrity. These skills are transferable to every facet of life and lay the foundation for future success, both personally and professionally.Fostering a Sense of CommunityClubs and societies serve as a bridge to forge connections and form lasting friendships. They create a sense of belonging, where students with shared interests come together to exchange ideas, support one another, and collaborate on projects. By creating an inclusive environment that values diversity, these clubs contribute to a thriving school community where mutual respect and understanding flourish.Balancing Academics and extracurriculars\nWhile academics remain of paramount importance, extracurricular activities offer a refreshing counterbalance. Engaging in activities that ignite passion revitalizes the mind and provides much-needed breaks from the rigour of academics. These moments of respite enhance overall mental well-being, alleviate stress, and invigorate students to approach their studies with renewed energy and enthusiasm.In conclusion, the revival of activities clubs and societies is not just a matter of rekindling the past; it's a vision for a richer, more holistic educational experience. By embracing these platforms, we embrace a journey of self-discovery, camaraderie, and all-around excellence that transcends the classroom walls.

She was known far and wide for her unwavering optimism and her ability to find joy in even the smallest of things. However, her family's humble lifestyle often tested her optimism.One year, a severe drought struck the village, causing crops to wither and water sources to dry up. The villagers grew anxious as their food supplies dwindled, and starvation loomed on the horizon. Lila's family, like the others, faced a dire situation. They had just a small loaf of bread left, barely enough to sustain them for a few days.Lila's father, a hardworking farmer, set off to the village square where a meeting was convened to discuss their predicament. As the villagers gathered, worry and despair etched on their faces, a wise old man named Ravi stood up and addressed the assembly.\"My friends,\" Ravi began, \"I understand the gravity of our situation. But we must not lose hope. In times of scarcity, we must remember the saying, 'Half a loaf is better than none.' Let us share what little we have and make the most of it.\"With Ravi's words, a glimmer of hope started to light up the faces of the villagers. They agreed to pool their resources and share their remaining food, ensuring that everyone would have at least a portion to sustain them.As days turned into weeks, the villagers worked together to find alternative sources of sustenance. They foraged for wild berries, caught small fish in the dwindling streams, and shared their meagre harvests. Despite the challenges, the village came together, strengthening the bonds of community.Meanwhile, Lila's family, though their small loaf of bread had been shared among them, managed to survive on the collective effort. Lila herself was instrumental in lifting the villagers' spirits. She organized games, told stories, and sang songs to distract them from their hunger and worries.One day, as the villagers were exploring a distant part of the hills, they stumbled upon a hidden oasis\u2014a glistening lake surrounded by fertile land. With their newfound discovery, they were able to rejuvenate their crops and secure a sustainable source of food and water.Lila's village emerged from the drought stronger and more united than ever. The lesson of sharing, cooperation, and embracing\u00a0even the smallest blessings had transformed their perspective. Ravi's words had become a guiding principle, reminding them that \"Half a loaf is better than none.\"In the years that followed, Lila's village thrived, its people thriving on the fruits of their unity and resilience. They never forgot the lessons learned during the drought, and the saying that once inspired them remained a testament to their triumph over adversity.And so, the story of Lila and her village became a beacon of hope, teaching generations to come that even in the face of scarcity, the willingness to share and make the most of what they had could lead to a bountiful future.",
