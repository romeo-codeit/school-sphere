We fed fat from all these, with a merry heart.When my father died, I was crowned the new village head of the Amanza Kingdom.

I regard your acceptance to the headship of this school as indicative of the great interest youhave in the welfare of our school. It is a noble gesture of which we are really proud of you. Mr. Adetusa Adebisi, my fellow students and l consider your posting to this college a wonderful privilege. We have therefore, organised this special meeting to express our delight and to give you a warm reception. We heartily welcome you to this great institution of learning.We have followed your career as a school principal with great interest. Your presence in any school has always brought about academic excellence and discipline.\u00a0We\u00a0are fully convinced that you have the zeal and talent to nurture the young to greatness. Your posting to our school is, indeed, the beginning of great expectations. We believe that you will find the necessary courage and strength to teach and direct us on to new paths. We are grateful to the State Ministry of Education for sending you to our school.One of the most important areas of need is poor staffing and unqualified teachers in the school. We wish that you laise with the State Ministry of Education in conjunction with the State Secondary Education Board to recruit and post enough and qualified teaching staff in the relevant subject areas to the school. The areas of need are English Language, Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Literature\u00a0in English, Civic Education, Economics, Accounting and others. This will help\u00a0to improve the\u00a0performance of the students in both internal and external examinations. For the past years the school had experienced mass failures in West African Senior School Certificate Examinations Council (NECO).

In order to improve the standard of education in the great school, therefore the teachers should leave no stone unturned in order to ensure that the students are properly taught.If the students are well taught, they will pass their examinations well and gain admission into universities without undue delay.Another area of need that demands your serious attention is unauthorised levies and dues. There are various recognised levies that the Government has authorised parents to pay, but the past principals of this school had subjected the parents to pay other numerous unauthorised levies and dues for their wards in the school. All these payments are made by the same parents who pay tuition fees, boarding fees as well as providing money for books, clothes, pocket money and other things. Some students dropped out of school as a result of their parents inability to pay all the authorised and unauthorised levies and dues for their wards. Collection of unauthorised levies and dues should be stopped in this school. This will be the only way to reduce the financial burden on parents and make the lives of the students worth living.Mr. Principal Sir, we believe that, God has sent you as a messiah to redeem this great institution from imminent collapse. We promise to give you maximum co-operation in your endeavour to restore the dignity of this institution. We have no doubt that you will attract highly proficient staff and better government support for the school during your stay.

It is a thing of great joy that this great citadel of learning has whethered the storm for these number of years.Without any fear of contradiction, this school is the oldest school in this part of Nigeria, after Hope Waddel Training Institution. Comprehensive High School, Isong Inyang Abatum has produced eminents and world class scholars, who have excelled in different fields of human Among these scholars produced by our great institution are Senator Michael Uche, Dr Moses Ndifon, Rev. father Titus Jeremiah just to mention a few.For this occasion, Sir, I use this medium to thank you for your landmark achievements in this great institution. Your wealth of experience and your high academic stand has made you a competent school administrator of this great institution. No one else is competent enough to pilot and managethe affairs of this school but you. This great courage has been repositioned to gain back her lost glory all to your own credit.Dear Sir, l as the former Senior Prefect of this great institution use this opportunity of the occasion of both anniversary celebration suggest that, these three areas in the school need improvement.Firstly, the area of sanitation in the school needs to be improved upon. The school need a standard toilet, to meet the demands of the teaming population growth in the school. The toilet should be built with modern facilities. You can bear me witness that the students defecations have litered the whole school because of lack of good toilet facilities. The students should be cautioned on how to keep themselves and the school compound clean at all times. Dumping of refuse indiscriminately in the school should be addressed with all amount of seriousness by the school authority.Secondly, the school needs to improve in the area of sporting activities. For some years now the school has not organised inter-house sport competitions. This has affected the school in the area of sporting activities. For instance, during the last Governor's cup football competition, the schoolcrashed out at the group stage in that competition.This was very shameful indeed. A standard football field should be built in the school. Other sporting events should be organised in the school, like volleyball, lawn tennis and others. Field events facilities like. Javelin, discuss and others should be made available in the school. Athletic events should also be improved upon. The loss glory of the school in sporting activities should be restored in a no distant time.Thirdly there should be improvement in the area of students staff relationship. A Careful obsevation shows that there is no cordial relationship between the students and the staff of this school. The teachers are harsh to the students. The teachers do not create rooms for students to approach them for counselling. The students rather\u00a0received wrong advice from the wrong people. This has affected the conducts and behaviours of\u00a0the students. Some teachers do not keep secrets revealed to them by the students. The teachers should be cautioned on how to handle such secrets from the students. The female staff should be made to counsel the female students and in the same\u00a0vein, the male teachers should be made to counsel the male, except in the area of specialty, but let one other person be present while the counselling is going on.I therefore thank you personally for piloting the affairs of this school descreetly and judiciously. If all the areas mentioned are give priority attention, I assure you that you will have a successful\u00a0tenure in your stay in this school.Thank you very much.\nYours faithfully,\nEmmanuel Akposi",

Your wealth of experience and your high academic stand has made you a competent school administrator of this great institution. No one else is competent enough to pilot and managethe affairs of this school but you. This great courage has been repositioned to gain back her lost glory all to your own credit.Dear Sir, l as the former Senior Prefect of this great institution use this opportunity of the occasion of both anniversary celebration suggest that, these three areas in the school need improvement.Firstly, the area of sanitation in the school needs to be improved upon. The school need a standard toilet, to meet the demands of the teaming population growth in the school. The toilet should be built with modern facilities. You can bear me witness that the students defecations have litered the whole school because of lack of good toilet facilities. The students should be cautioned on how to keep themselves and the school compound clean at all times. Dumping of refuse indiscriminately in the school should be addressed with all amount of seriousness by the school authority.Secondly, the school needs to improve in the area of sporting activities. For some years now the school has not organised inter-house sport competitions. This has affected the school in the area of sporting activities. For instance, during the last Governor's cup football competition, the schoolcrashed out at the group stage in that competition.This was very shameful indeed. A standard football field should be built in the school. Other sporting events should be organised in the school, like volleyball, lawn tennis and others. Field events facilities like. Javelin, discuss and others should be made available in the school. Athletic events should also be improved upon. The loss glory of the school in sporting activities should be restored in a no distant time.Thirdly there should be improvement in the area of students staff relationship. A Careful obsevation shows that there is no cordial relationship between the students and the staff of this school. The teachers are harsh to the students. The teachers do not create rooms for students to approach them for counselling. The students rather\u00a0received wrong advice from the wrong people. This has affected the conducts and behaviours of\u00a0the students. Some teachers do not keep secrets revealed to them by the students. The teachers should be cautioned on how to handle such secrets from the students. The female staff should be made to counsel the female students and in the same\u00a0vein, the male teachers should be made to counsel the male, except in the area of specialty, but let one other person be present while the counselling is going on.I therefore thank you personally for piloting the affairs of this school descreetly and judiciously. If all the areas mentioned are give priority attention, I assure you that you will have a successful\u00a0tenure in your stay in this school.Thank you very much.\nYours faithfully,\nEmmanuel Akposi",
