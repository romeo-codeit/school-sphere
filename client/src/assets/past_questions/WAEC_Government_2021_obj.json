This means that the component units retain the majority of the power and authority, while the central government has limited powers that are delegated to it by the component units.\nIn a federal system, sovereignty is shared between the central government and the component units. Both levels of government have constitutionally guaranteed powers, and neither is fully sovereign over the other. In a monarchical system, sovereignty is typically vested in the monarch or the central government, not in the component units. In a republican system, sovereignty resides with the people and is exercised through elected representatives. The distribution of power can vary, but it does not imply that all component units are sovereign.",
