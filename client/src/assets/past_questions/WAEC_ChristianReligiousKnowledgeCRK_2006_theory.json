Gehazi, Elisha's servant, regretted his master's refusal of Naaman's gifts and swore to collect a reward. So, he ran after Naaman who halted on sighting him. Gehazi lied to him that visitors came to him unexpectedly. He said Elisha requested a talent of silver and two festal garments, which Naaman quickly obliged and even begged to give two talents which his two servants conveyed for Gehazi. At the house, Gehazi took the items and sent the servants away secretly. When Elisha asked where he went, he denied going anywhere. Elisha asked if his spirit did not follow him and whether it was time for acquisition of wealth. He then ordered that Naaman's leprosy be transferred to Gehazi and his descendants for ever. Gehazi left Elisha's presence a leper, as white as snow.\nb) The lessons that can be learnt from Gehazi's conduct are:\n(i) It is not good to be greedy or materialistic.\n(ii) It is wrong to lie to cover an offence.\n(iii) Elisha was a prophet; we should know the kind of people we deal with.\n(iv) One can get diseases (e.g. AIDS) through secret deals/sinful acts.\n(v)The consequences of sin can be generational.\n(vi) God knows the secret sins of man.",

He admonished that they should lay their treasures in heaven where it\u00a0would be safe. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. According to Jesus, the eye is the amp of the body. So, if the eye is sound, the whole body would be full of light. However, if the eye is not sound, the whole body would be full of darkness. If the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness? Jesus asked. No\u00a0one can serve two masters, said Jesus: for either he would hate one and love the other. Or he will be devoted to th one and despise the other. According to Jesus, no one can serve God and Mammon.\n(ii) Sermon on the mount under Anxiety: Jesus taught that people should not be anxious about their life; what the shall eat or drink. Or about their body; what they shall put on. According to Jesus, life is more than food and th body more than clothing. He also said that birds neither sow nor reap or gather, but are fed by God. According t Jesus, human beings are of more value than birds. He asked if by being anxious one can add a cubit to his stature, He wondered why people should be anxious about clothing. The lilies do not toil or spin, but according to Jesus they are better arrayed than Solomon. Jesus said God who clothed the grass will clothe the people and admonishes that they should have more faith as he tagged them, men of little faith.

    "correct_answer": "(a) Paul treated the problem of idleness among the Thessalonian Christians in the following ways: Paul commanded the Thessalonian believers to avoid any lazy person among them. He reminded them that he did not extort money from any one of them but had worked hard to earn his living. Paul told them that he had a right as a preacher to depend on them for maintenance, but had chosen to work in order to lay an example for them. He had earlier instructed that anyone who is not willing to work should not eat. He commanded and encouraged the lazy brethren to work hard to earn their living. Paul also advised them as brethren not to be fed up in well-doing. However, he advised that anyone who refuses to obey the instructions in this letter, should be isolated. Such a lazy one should not be regarded as an enemy though. Rather, he should be warned as a brother.\n(b) Reasons why Christians should engage in gainful employment are:\n(i) Christians should be gainfully employed to avoid undue temptation to do evil.\n(ii) They should be willing to take up any legitimate job to earn their living.\n(iii) Employed Christians should not be a burden to anyone, parents, relatives and friends.\n(iv) Such Christians become assets to themselves and others.\n(v) They are happy serving God without murmuring or grudging.\n(vi) They become a motivation to other young people around them.",

    "correct_answer": "(a) James' concept of works in relation to faith: To James, hearing the word is good but doing what is heard brings blessing to the doer. It is of no benefit to declare faith which is not matched by works. For James, faith is an abstract expression which, in concrete terms, is put in action by works. Practical response to the needs of brethren profits more than mere verbal expression of faith (\"Go in peace, be warmed and filled\"). James further said that one's work can prove one's faith. It is not enough to believe that God is one, for even demons believe and shudder.Abraham's faith was justified when he offered Isaac his son upon the altar. So, his faith was active along with his works and was completed by his works. By Abraham's action, James insists that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone. That means that faith and works go together, one complementing the other. Rahab, the harlot, believed the spies were God's people. She treated them kindly for her own rescue and her works justified her faith. James thus declared: \"As the body apart from the spirit is dead, so faith apart from works is dead.\"\n(b) Ways by which Christians should demonstrate their faith in their daily life:\n(i) Christians should establish vocational/technical institutions for training of the unemployed.\n(ii) They should obey those in government/authority.\n(iii) They should ensure good governance by participating in government.\n(iv) They should help the poor and needy.\n(v) They should participate in Church activities.\n(vi) They should establish orphanages/mental homes/vocations, etc.",
