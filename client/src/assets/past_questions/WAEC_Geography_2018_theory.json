    "correct_answer": "(a)\u2022 EMPLOYMENT GENERATION:Industrialization encourages mass production of goods. This require more labour to achieve.\nAnd so would lead to employment of capable hands in the production process.\nAlso, as the country industrialize, more people would be employed to keep up with the production rate.\n\u2022 IMPROVED LIVING STANDARD/POVERTY REDUCTION:As employment is generated, the number of unemployed reduces. This goes to reduce poverty in the country. Also, increased industrial output means that the masses now have variety of goods to choose from at affordable prices. This equally goes to improve the living standards of the populace.\n(b)1. Power Crisis\nPower failure has been a problem in Nigeria since day one. It is quite unfortunate that after the privatization of the power company, we still haven\u2019t witnessed any outstanding improvement in power supply.\nElectricity is a very important and indispensable tool to industrialization. Most manufacturing processes are automated, computers and machines are not powered by water but by electricity, and in a situation where this driving force is dysfunctional, there is bound to be an impediment to most if not all industrial activities.\n2. Misappropriation of Funds by Government\nSome time ago, the federal government approved N3.9billion for power transmission infrastructure, weeks after the approval of N1.3billion for manpower development and training of 3,700 people under National Power Sector Apprenticeship Scheme (NAPSAS). And then I questioned myself, why is government still spending so much money on power projects after privatizing the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN)?\nFrom my own understanding and dictionary meaning of the word \u201cPrivatization\u201d, it entails the removal of something (PHCN) from governments control and placing it in private control or ownership; but why are they still getting involved? These are funds which could have been used to remedy other situations such as bad roads in order to favour industrialization.\n3. Excessive Dependence of Nigerians on Imported Goods\nNigerians are being overly dependent on imported and \u201cmade in abroad\u201d goods, regardless of the quality and safety. This particular observation has led to the exploitation of consumers by Nigerian based manufacturers and suppliers.\nSome manufacturers now affiliate with Chinese companies to produce substandard products which is then shipped down to Nigeria.\nThe ones fortunate enough to produce theirs within Nigeria now resort to the replacement of the right country of production with a foreign country. You now get to see shoes coupled by a shoemaker at your backyard wearing tags such as \u201cmade in Italy\u201d, \u201cmade in China\u201d and you wonder, why the lies? It\u2019s quite obvious because that\u2019s what Nigerians like and want, they prefer \u201cmade in Italy/china\u201d to \u201cmade in Nigeria\u201d and shoemakers must sell their products right? So they just exploit Nigerian\u2019s taste to sell theirs.\n4. Lack of Finance\nSetting up a company or industry is nothing compared to renting a shop and stocking it with imported products. Though both require capital and a good financial strength but it is more pronounced in industrial setup. Lack of finance by skilled and potential entrepreneurs therefore constitutes one of the major problem to industrialization.\n(c)* Energy efficiency and conservation\nIn order to prevent an energy crisis, it is also crucial that we consume less energy by improving and modernisingenergy infrastructuresuch assmart grid solutions, andsmart cities. It is also important that we replace old devices by energy efficient solutions, such as replacing traditional light bulbs by LEDs.\nlack of finace\n*Creating a monthly plan for your spending is one of the smartest things you can do for your finances, yet it\u2019s the most overlooked solution to most people\u2019s financial problems. Having a spending plan or a budget (the technical name for a monthly spending plan) makes life so much easier because you\u2019ve given yourself a guide to decide how you want to spend your money.\nIronically, it\u2019s also one of the things that you\u2019ll likely never learn in a class at Cambridge or Harvard. Not to pick on these universities though; most schools don\u2019t teach students how to create a budget. So to help with this lack of training, your third assignment is to outline your budget.\nIf you\u2019ve never created a household budget that works, here is apersonal budget workbookto get you started or you can try outthis interactive budgeting resource that guides you through the whole process. A budget based on real numbers sets you up for success, so use what you learned when you tracked your spending.\nIf there\u2019s an expense you want to cut out of your budget, start by reducing it by half. This will tell you if you can stick it out for the long term. If you can make having a budget part of your life, you\u2019ll know that you\u2019ve passed this assignment successfully!\n*Digitizing the entire workflow means setting up a network-based environment or revenue management system where all the workflows regarding generating orders, making payments, generating receipts, recording data, and much more are all linked in one central system. When this is done, it ensures that every operation in the organisation is centralised, can be monitored remotely, and that the accounts can easily be reconciled since data is automatically recorded once an activity is done.",

This particular observation has led to the exploitation of consumers by Nigerian based manufacturers and suppliers.\nSome manufacturers now affiliate with Chinese companies to produce substandard products which is then shipped down to Nigeria.\nThe ones fortunate enough to produce theirs within Nigeria now resort to the replacement of the right country of production with a foreign country. You now get to see shoes coupled by a shoemaker at your backyard wearing tags such as \u201cmade in Italy\u201d, \u201cmade in China\u201d and you wonder, why the lies? It\u2019s quite obvious because that\u2019s what Nigerians like and want, they prefer \u201cmade in Italy/china\u201d to \u201cmade in Nigeria\u201d and shoemakers must sell their products right? So they just exploit Nigerian\u2019s taste to sell theirs.\n4. Lack of Finance\nSetting up a company or industry is nothing compared to renting a shop and stocking it with imported products. Though both require capital and a good financial strength but it is more pronounced in industrial setup. Lack of finance by skilled and potential entrepreneurs therefore constitutes one of the major problem to industrialization.\n(c)* Energy efficiency and conservation\nIn order to prevent an energy crisis, it is also crucial that we consume less energy by improving and modernisingenergy infrastructuresuch assmart grid solutions, andsmart cities. It is also important that we replace old devices by energy efficient solutions, such as replacing traditional light bulbs by LEDs.\nlack of finace\n*Creating a monthly plan for your spending is one of the smartest things you can do for your finances, yet it\u2019s the most overlooked solution to most people\u2019s financial problems. Having a spending plan or a budget (the technical name for a monthly spending plan) makes life so much easier because you\u2019ve given yourself a guide to decide how you want to spend your money.\nIronically, it\u2019s also one of the things that you\u2019ll likely never learn in a class at Cambridge or Harvard. Not to pick on these universities though; most schools don\u2019t teach students how to create a budget. So to help with this lack of training, your third assignment is to outline your budget.\nIf you\u2019ve never created a household budget that works, here is apersonal budget workbookto get you started or you can try outthis interactive budgeting resource that guides you through the whole process. A budget based on real numbers sets you up for success, so use what you learned when you tracked your spending.\nIf there\u2019s an expense you want to cut out of your budget, start by reducing it by half. This will tell you if you can stick it out for the long term. If you can make having a budget part of your life, you\u2019ll know that you\u2019ve passed this assignment successfully!\n*Digitizing the entire workflow means setting up a network-based environment or revenue management system where all the workflows regarding generating orders, making payments, generating receipts, recording data, and much more are all linked in one central system. When this is done, it ensures that every operation in the organisation is centralised, can be monitored remotely, and that the accounts can easily be reconciled since data is automatically recorded once an activity is done.",

    "correct_answer": "(a)*Heat and Metamorphism\n*Pressure and Metamorphism\n*Chemical Action of Fluids\n(c)There are three main types of rocks: sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic. Each of these rocks are formed by physical changes\u2014such as\u00a0melting,\u00a0cooling, eroding, compacting, or deforming\u2014that are part of the rock\u00a0cycle.Sedimentary RocksSedimentary rocks are formed from pieces of other existing rock or\u00a0organic\u00a0material. There are three different types of sedimentary rocks: clastic, organic (biological), and\u00a0chemical. Clastic sedimentary rocks, like sandstone, form from clasts, or pieces of other rock. Organic sedimentary rocks, like coal, form from hard, biological materials like plants, shells, and bones that are compressed into rock.The formation of clastic and organic rocks begins with the\u00a0weathering, or breaking down, of the exposed rock into small fragments. Through the process of\u00a0erosion, these fragments are removed from their source and transported by wind, water, ice, or biological activity to a new location. Once the sediment settles somewhere, and enough of it collects, the lowest layers become compacted so tightly that they form solid rock.Chemical sedimentary rocks, like limestone, halite, and flint, form from chemical precipitation. A chemical precipitate is a chemical compound\u2014for instance, calcium carbonate, salt, and silica\u2014that forms when the solution it is dissolved in, usually water, evaporates and leaves the compound behind. This occurs as water travels through Earth\u2019s crust, weathering the rock and dissolving some of its minerals, transporting it elsewhere. These dissolved minerals are precipitated when the water evaporates.Metamorphic RocksMetamorphic rocks are rocks that have been changed from their original form by immense heat or pressure. Metamorphic rocks have two classes: foliated and nonfoliated. When a rock with flat or elongated minerals is put under immense pressure, the minerals line up in layers, creating\u00a0foliation. Foliation is the aligning of elongated or platy minerals, like hornblende or mica, perpendicular to the direction of pressure that is applied. An example of this transformation can be seen with granite, an\u00a0igneous rock. Granite contains long and platy minerals that are not initially aligned, but when enough pressure is added, those minerals shift to all point in the same direction while getting squeezed into flat sheets. When granite undergoes this process, like at a tectonic plate boundary, it turns into gneiss (pronounced \u201cnice\u201d).Nonfoliated rocks are formed the same way, but they do not contain the minerals that tend to line up under pressure and thus do not have the layered appearance of foliated rocks. Sedimentary rocks like bituminous coal, limestone, and sandstone, given enough heat and pressure, can turn into nonfoliated metamorphic rocks like anthracite coal, marble, and quartzite. Nonfoliated rocks can also form by metamorphism, which happens when magma comes in contact with the surrounding rock.Igneous RocksIgneous rocks (derived from the Latin word for fire) are formed when molten hot material cools and solidifies. Igneous rocks can also be made a couple of different ways. When they are formed inside of the earth, they are called intrusive, or plutonic, igneous rocks. If they are formed outside or on top of Earth\u2019s crust, they are called extrusive, or volcanic, igneous rocks.Granite and diorite are examples of common intrusive rocks. They have a coarse texture with large mineral grains, indicating that they spent thousands or millions of years cooling down inside the earth, a time course that allowed large mineral crystals to grow.Alternatively, rocks like basalt and obsidian have very small grains and a relatively fine texture. This happens because when magma erupts into lava, it cools more quickly than it would if it stayed inside the earth, giving crystals less time to form. Obsidian cools into volcanic glass so quickly when ejected that the grains are impossible to see with the naked eye.Extrusive igneous rocks can also have a vesicular, or \u201choley\u201d texture. This happens when the ejected magma still has gases inside of it so when it cools, the gas bubbles are trapped and end up giving the rock a bubbly texture.
