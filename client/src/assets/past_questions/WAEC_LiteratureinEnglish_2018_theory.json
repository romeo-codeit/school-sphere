Assisted by Maligu his 'wise counsellor' and Soko, the priest, and his son who is Chief of the Warriors, he appears to be heading towards a quiet and peaceful death in his dotage (old age).\nHowever, Santigi's kingdom is suddenly ruffled by the news of Soko's contrived divination of a white stranger appeared in the land.

Mr. Whitehead, who has sent his messenger/secretary (interpreter...,), Mr. Parker (for short) before him, appears, much against the custom of the people and does not pay his respects to the king upon arrival, which is also against custom. Kindo the king's son, points this out, but his appeal is ignored by the king who rigidly insists on things being done according to custom.\nWhitehead's arrival in Mando land bodes no good for the people of Mando land under Santigi's reign. In complicity with Maligu and Soko, he deceives the King (urged on by Soko and Maligu) that he brings prosperity to Mando land through the introduction of tobacco farming, when his real interest is the land's diamond. Kindo, who suspects his real motive, which is exploiting the diamond resource of the land, is never listened to by his father, the king. Thus, Santigi's reign is characterised by the violation of custom after custom; for instance, the custom which forbids the people to smoke tobacco (Maligu, Soko and the king indulge in this pastime). Later, the people become addicted to tobacco, alcohol and hard drugs and, as reported by Kindo, the men and women engage in sexual orgies, as societal norms and restrictions are abandoned \" in the name of happiness under the very eyes of Santigi\". A normally self-sustaining farming people lose the will to work hard and embrace laziness, rather.\nThings do not improve, even at this stage, as Whitehead and his accomplices, Maligu and Soko, single out Kindo, the King's son, as the main obstacle to pursuing their greed for money and wealth.. They hatch a plot which receives the king's support. To atone for the arrival of the stranger within, there should be a sacrifice involving \" the blood of a stranger born in another place\". Soko interprets this as being the blood of a virgin. Wara, Kindo's woman, is chosen. However, such is the distrust between the accomplices that Soko spares Wara's life and on the day of the sacrifice, Kindo kills Parker, Whitehead's secretary, who then becomes the sacrificial lamb. Santigi sits on his throne unaware of the demands of his own custom and acquiesces to Wara being sacrificed instead. It takes Kindo to expose the grand deception and\u00a0the killing of Whitehead to stop the descent into the depravity that has engulfed the people. Ironically, Kindo's banishment is sanctioned by his own father, King Santigi, according to custom.\nHere, therefore, is a kind who, though old and insistent on tradition, has no high moral integrity to show in his violation of custom for money. Instead of protecting his people from outside negative influence, he superintends a corrupt and effete society which is unlikely to improve under an equally corrupt Maligu, if he should die and Kindo is unable to return from banishment.\nWhen it emerges that it is Parker who has been sacrificed instead, Whitehead calls for the enforcement of the tradition which prescribes death for anybody who kills in peace time. Whitehead in turn dies on Kindo's sword, accidentally.",

According to Judge, \"For all the atrocities you must have perpetrated in this country under the cover of Minister, which have not been detected, I say nothing.\" Chief then faces four counts of embezzlement, involving 1.2 billion naira and 5.8 million naira (two counts); dealing in cocaine and corrupting a public officer.\nProsecution Counsel clearly outlines the role of the police in their investigation and what makes each accused person culpable. Inspector Inaku's evidence is clear and concise. What triggers police investigation is set down as \"Miss Ogeyi Ogar and the Jacassan Flash of 21st June, 1997\". Following the newspaper report, the inspector goes to the Ministry and bribes Mr. Ayo to get access to official documents. By the inspector's own admission, Mr. Ayo does not ask for a bribe; rather, the Clerical Officer \"promised to cooperate after I enticed him with the sum of two thousand naira\". This show of zeal is wrong. The law seems to be that both the giver and the receiver of a bribe are criminals. One would expect; then, that the court reprimand or even\u00a0sentence inspector I naku once Mr. Ayo goes in for five years.\nIn her evidence, Ogeyi clearly tells Aloho's story and firmly incriminates Chief. Her reason for going to the police is consistent with her love for her late friend; failing to persuade Aloha not to abort the pregnancy, she \"was moved to go to the police to relate the story\". However, Chief lies on oath, alleging that the \"cocaine had been put there to incriminated\" him. In the end, the court does not believe him and his breaking down avails him nothing. Of the two, Ogeyi is found credible by the court.\nBoth counsels do their work to the best of their abilities.

He draws the court's attention to the relevant flaws in the case of the defence and leaves the rest to the judge and the jury.

Blake uses the natural rhythm of speech to convey this theme, particularly as he allows the boy to express himself in his own language, as much as possible. Apart from the rhymed stanzas, most of the lines read like colloquial speech. The following examples illustrate the point. In stanza one, the boy expresses his love of summer in the words: \"I love to rise in a summer morn\". Then in stanza two, he expresses his unhappiness about going to school in the line,\" Oh it drives all joy away\". Many more lines are couched in such monosyllabic words.\nIn addition to the above expressions, it can be said that the very words used in the poem are simple. Indeed, the longest word used in the entire poem is \"mellowing\" which is made up of three syllables. Words associated with spring and summer are used to describe the seasons positively. They include \"sing\", \"joy\" \"sweet company\", \"blossom\" and so on. The focus of the poem being summer, such words express the boy's delight in being associated with its activities. Similarly, in referring to spring time, he refers to \"bud\" and \"blossom\". However, words associated with school do not have positive associations. In school, the boy talks about \"sighing\" and \"dismay\" and \"dropping\". The teachers are \"a cruel eye outworn\" and school, which should be \"learning's bower\" has become a \"dreary shower\", The boy associates his misery with that of a \"bird caged\" and unable to \"sing\" or with that of a tender plant that has been \"stripped\" of its leaves, or with that of \"buds that have been nipped before they blossom\".\nIndeed, there are many more negative words and expressions in the poem. These illustrate the boy's melancholic mood as he laments his inability to enjoy summer because of the insensitivity of his parents to his feelings and natural inclinations by sending him to school. However, beyond this meaning is one larger, which is the need to give children the opportunity to be self-expressive , so they can psychologically withstand the crisis of adulthood. It is to the poet's credit that such profound wisdom is conveyed in the simplicity of the vocabulary or diction.",

    "correct_answer": "Manfred, the Prince of Otranto, is married to Hippolita, a lady he later points out to be a distant relation of his.\nThey have two children, Matilda, their eighteen-year-old daughter and Conrad, their fifteen-year-old son.\nHippolita is described as \"an amiable lady\" and is presented in the novel as a subservient wife who treats her husband with utmost respect. Her love for and dedication to her husband is not reciprocated. This is so because Manfred's attitude towards her is one of utter disdain, though he himself says of her, \"true, I honour Hippolita's virtue, I think her a saint...\".\nIn the first place, he does not take her suggestions into consideration. When Manfred hatches the plot for the marriage between Conrad and Isabella, Hippolita calls his attention to the fact that Conrad, their ailing son, is too young to marry. Manfred responds by blaming her inability to give him more than one heir. The marriage plan ends disastrously with the mysterious death of Conrad on the wedding day.\nManfred's inhumane treatment of his wife only intensifies after Conrad's death. Hippolita, onrecovering from the initial shock at the news, demands regular updates on her \"lord\" \u2014 the way she refers to Manfred. Manfred, on the other hand, does not even mention his wife or daughter, as the first words he utters to the ladies in the chapel after the incident are: \"Take care of the Lady Isabella\". Hippolita sends Matilda, their daughter to see how Manfred is coping with his loss. When Matilda attempts to do so, she cannot find words to explain to her mother the 'bitter' reception she has received from her father, on her return to Hippolita.\nHippolita, on her part, registers her disappointment that Manfred has not requested to see her when she says mournfully: \"But will he not let me see him? Will he not permit me to blend my tears with his, and shed a mother's sorrow in the bossom of her lord?\"She is also worried that Conrad's tragic death must have affected Manfred very badly and demands that she be taken to see him, when she says to her maids: \"Raise me, my maidens; I will see my lord. Bear me to him instantly: He is dearer to me than my children.\"\nIt is heart-rending that Manfred does not care or ask to see his wife but sends to summon Isabella instead. Hippolita, in her innocence, thinks that Manfred is apprehensive of meeting herself and Matilda and that, that is why he chooses to send for Isabella instead. She tells Isabella, \"Console him. dear Isabella and tell him I will smother my own anguish rather than add to his\".\nThis is contrary to an ideal marriage relationship situation where, at least, both the husband and wife show concern for each other. Little does Hippolita know that Manfred is desirous to propose to Isabella. She trusts her husband very much.\nWhen Isabella, on hearing the proposal, flees the castle, Manfred is in hot pursuit of her. Recognising Manfred's footsteps on the stairs, Hippolita hastily goes out anxious to meet him for the first time after son's death. He pushes her \"rudely off' demanding to know Isabella's whereabouts and even mentions Hippolita is jealous of Isabella. Hippolita, though surprised at this utterance, being the obedient wife she is, carries out Manfred's orders to send he-chaplain to him. Hippolita later tells Manfred that the 'gigantic leg' is just a figment of the imagination Manfred is relieved but his attitude towards his does not improve; in fact, it gets worse.\nIt is evident that the relationship between Manfred and his wife is strange and appears to be unhappy one for hippolita.",
    "explanation": "Manfred, the Prince of Otranto, is married to Hippolita, a lady he later points out to be a distant relation of his.\nThey have two children, Matilda, their eighteen-year-old daughter and Conrad, their fifteen-year-old son.\nHippolita is described as \"an amiable lady\" and is presented in the novel as a subservient wife who treats her husband with utmost respect. Her love for and dedication to her husband is not reciprocated. This is so because Manfred's attitude towards her is one of utter disdain, though he himself says of her, \"true, I honour Hippolita's virtue, I think her a saint...\".\nIn the first place, he does not take her suggestions into consideration. When Manfred hatches the plot for the marriage between Conrad and Isabella, Hippolita calls his attention to the fact that Conrad, their ailing son, is too young to marry. Manfred responds by blaming her inability to give him more than one heir. The marriage plan ends disastrously with the mysterious death of Conrad on the wedding day.\nManfred's inhumane treatment of his wife only intensifies after Conrad's death. Hippolita, onrecovering from the initial shock at the news, demands regular updates on her \"lord\" \u2014 the way she refers to Manfred. Manfred, on the other hand, does not even mention his wife or daughter, as the first words he utters to the ladies in the chapel after the incident are: \"Take care of the Lady Isabella\". Hippolita sends Matilda, their daughter to see how Manfred is coping with his loss. When Matilda attempts to do so, she cannot find words to explain to her mother the 'bitter' reception she has received from her father, on her return to Hippolita.\nHippolita, on her part, registers her disappointment that Manfred has not requested to see her when she says mournfully: \"But will he not let me see him? Will he not permit me to blend my tears with his, and shed a mother's sorrow in the bossom of her lord?\"She is also worried that Conrad's tragic death must have affected Manfred very badly and demands that she be taken to see him, when she says to her maids: \"Raise me, my maidens; I will see my lord. Bear me to him instantly: He is dearer to me than my children.\"\nIt is heart-rending that Manfred does not care or ask to see his wife but sends to summon Isabella instead. Hippolita, in her innocence, thinks that Manfred is apprehensive of meeting herself and Matilda and that, that is why he chooses to send for Isabella instead. She tells Isabella, \"Console him. dear Isabella and tell him I will smother my own anguish rather than add to his\".\nThis is contrary to an ideal marriage relationship situation where, at least, both the husband and wife show concern for each other. Little does Hippolita know that Manfred is desirous to propose to Isabella. She trusts her husband very much.\nWhen Isabella, on hearing the proposal, flees the castle, Manfred is in hot pursuit of her. Recognising Manfred's footsteps on the stairs, Hippolita hastily goes out anxious to meet him for the first time after son's death. He pushes her \"rudely off' demanding to know Isabella's whereabouts and even mentions Hippolita is jealous of Isabella. Hippolita, though surprised at this utterance, being the obedient wife she is, carries out Manfred's orders to send he-chaplain to him. Hippolita later tells Manfred that the 'gigantic leg' is just a figment of the imagination Manfred is relieved but his attitude towards his does not improve; in fact, it gets worse.\nIt is evident that the relationship between Manfred and his wife is strange and appears to be unhappy one for hippolita.",
