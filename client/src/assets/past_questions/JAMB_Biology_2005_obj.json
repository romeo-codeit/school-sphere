    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Centrioles are primarily found in animal cells, where they play a crucial role in cell division by organizing microtubules and forming the spindle fibers that separate chromosomes.\u00a0While centrioles are generally absent in higher plants, they can be found in some lower plants and in the male gametes of certain plant species.\nThe plasmalemma, also known as the cell membrane or plasma membrane, is a biological membrane that\u00a0separates the cell's interior from the external environment, regulating the movement of materials and facilitating communication.The plasmalemma (or cell membrane) is a common structure found in both plant and animal cells, but not regarded as an organelle, rather the outer boundary of the cell, separating the inside from the outside environment, and it's a membrane, not an organelle.\nCell walls are a defining feature of plant cells, but are absent in animal cells.\u00a0Plant cells have a rigid cell wall surrounding the cell membrane, which provides structural support and protection. Also,\u00a0a cell wall is not considered an organelle, but rather a non-membrane-bound, extracellular structure that provides support and protection to cells, particularly in plants, fungi, and bacteria.\nPlant cells have chloroplast and cell walls, whereas animal cells do not. Plant cells must be rigid to maintain their posture, and they require chlorophyll, which is found in the chloroplast, for food production.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

It\u00a0is designed for flexibility and a wide range of motion, allowing the arms to move in many directions while the pelvic girdle connects the lower limbs (legs) to the axial skeleton, supporting the body's weight and transferring it to the lower limbs.\nThe pelvic girdle, also known as the hip girdle, consists of\u00a0two hip bones (also called coxal bones), each formed by the fusion of the ilium, ischium, and pubis, along with the sacrum and coccyx.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
