However, it\u00a0is often treated with antibiotics.\nThe parasitic disease\u00a0amebiasis, often known as amoebic dysentery, is caused by the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica, and can lead to a range of symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever.\nE. coli (Escherichia coli) bacteria can cause\u00a0diarrhea, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and other health problems.\nShigella, a bacteria, primarily causes\u00a0shigellosis, a diarrheal illness characterized by symptoms like fever, stomach pain, and often bloody diarrhea.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "explanation": "Hypertonic urine is\u00a0highly concentrated urine with a higher solute concentration than water, formed to conserve water in the body, especially during dehydration.\nMammals are able to produce hypertonic urine due to the unique structure and function of the Loop of Henle in the kidneys:\n- The Loop of Henle has a counter-current multiplier system that allows for the reabsorption of water and ions, concentrating the urine.\n- The descending limb of the Loop of Henle is permeable to water, allowing water to be reabsorbed into the medulla.\n- The ascending limb is impermeable to water, but actively reabsorbs ions, increasing the osmolarity of the medulla.\nThis process enables mammals to produce urine that is more concentrated than the blood, which is essential for conserving water.\nThe correct answer is D -\u00a0Loop of Henle\nThe other options are not correct:\n- Bowman's capsule (A) is the initial part of the nephron where filtration occurs, but it's not responsible for reabsorption.\n- Urethra (B) is the tube that carries urine out of the body, not involved in urine concentration.\n- Ureter (C) is the tube that carries urine from the kidneys to the bladder, also not involved in urine concentration.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
