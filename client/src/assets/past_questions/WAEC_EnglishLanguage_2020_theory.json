Big bro, i\u00a0got an information about you dropping out of school, I thought it was a joke not until a friend of yours Confirmed it. Big bro, I actually don't know your reasons for wanting to do this but I must say it is not a good idea. First and foremost, you know the condition of mummy's health and her business, you are the reason she is striving hard through this business, just to help you go through school, making sure you come out strong.

Big bro, there are many reasons why you don't have to go on with this decision to stop schooling and go into business but with these points, I believe I can convince you enough not to scale through with it. Please note that if you go ahead with your dropping out of school, you will hurt mummy and make her health deteriorate the more, which might lead to something worse and I am sure you wont want that to happen to her, not after all her sufferings just to see you through school. I earnestly plead with you to rethink this decision of yours. Best wishes big brother. I do hope you heed to my advice even though it is coming from your younger brother. I want to believe that the next time I will get any information about this; it will be a positive one in order to put a smile on my face.

    "correct_answer": "THE IMPORTANCE OF PROMOTING GOOD READING HABITS IN STUDENTSReading is one of the most fundamental skills a child needs to know and learn to succeed in life. Developing good reading habit is vital to your child's future not just academically but in everyday life. The practice of good reading helps in building the personality of a student which includes; helping the student differentiate between facts and opinion, understand situations and their effects which gives him access to a good stock of vocabulary: Good reading habits make the students confident as well as develop their communication skills which in turn improve their moral and ethical knowledge. Inspirational purpose is another reason why reading habits should be promoted. Teachers and parents might not be able to get all the opportunities to encourage and inspire students, but books can. All that the teachers and parents need to do, is promote reading habits among these students and off they go. There are a lot of encouraging and inspiring books such as the 'gifted hands; think big, and so on which are written by the famous neurosurgeon, Dr. Ben Carson. And when reading such books are promoted among students, even the sky would not be their limit. It is very importance to promote good reading habits in students because reading can also help and prepare them for the broader aspect of life. Also, good reading habits help students score well on both internal and external examinations and this of course brings about excellent grades. Furthermore, reading can also make students know more about themselves and cherish who they are and who they could be in future. Books such as 'temperament and you and why you act the way you do teach about temperament and the strength and weaknesses of these temperaments. These books and various other kinds of books like these, assist students in discovering their strengths and weaknesses and how to manage them. And all these can only be achieved by promoting good reading habits among students. Conclusively, reading habits in students can be promoted by creating reading friendly environments both in schools and at home and engaging students and discussing topics on whatever they have read. To effectively conclude, it iS said \"A good reader becomes an excellent speaker and a good writer as well.",

In addition, I also want to congratulate you on being a great leader and good example to the teachers and students of this school.I\u00a0want to bring to your notice some practices among students that should be discouraged and habits that should be promoted among the teachers so as to provide a better learning environment.These practices among the students are negative and do not speak well of our school. One of these negative practices is gambling. Students engage in gambling which place them at a risk of being unfocused on their studies. Also, it places them at a risk of losing their feeding allowances because they have to stake bets with the only money on them and thereby when they lose such bets, they are left to go hungry. These gambling activities have more often than not led to outbreaks of arguments and fights among the students. More importantly, this practice does not encourage students to be more responsible but instead be careless and reckless.Therefore, I would like to suggest that this practice of gambling be discouraged and terminated by setting in place rules and regulations that will guide against gambling and also enforce suitable punishments for any student caught in the act.Another negative practice which has been embraced by the students in recent times is examination malpractices. This of course is a dishonest and wrong way to achieve good and excellent grades. Students who engage in this practice are likely not to pay attention in class nor read their books and prepare adequately for examinations because they believe they can smuggle their notebooks, textbooks or any foreign material into the examination hall.This encourages laziness and unseriousness in students and I would like to suggest that more examination rules and regulations be set; for example students should be thoroughly searched before allowed to come into the examination hall and adequate number of examination invigilators be placed in the hails too.Our teachers are very hardworking and also very committed to teaching and this is very commendable. I, on behalf of other students of this prestigious school, hope that these habits are promoted more and more in our teachers. We hope for more teachers who take their time to teach to the understanding of their students and teachers who engage more with their students.In conclusion, I would like to thank you for the time taken to read through this letter and earnestly hope that necessary steps be taken to put an end to negative practices exhibited among the students and the promotion of positive habits among the teachers.\nYours faithfullyMBA, OLUCHI MARY",
