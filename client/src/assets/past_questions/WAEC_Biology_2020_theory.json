    "correct_answer": "(a) How the human ear carries out its function of balancing;\n- Head movement in any direction affect the fluid/endolymph, In the semi-circular canals, Which are at right angles to each other, The movement forces the sensory/hair cells in the ampulla to set up the impulses, The brain interprets the impulses and relays the impulses to the body muscles for balancing.\n(b)(i) Diagram of the Human Ear;\n(b)(ii) Description of the structure of the middle ear; The middle ear is an air filled chamber, It connects the ear drum of the oval window fenestra ovalis. It contains three bones/hammer/malleus, anvil/incus and stapes/stirrup/ear ossicles. The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane/tympanum/eardrum. Each of the bones has direct contact with the one next to it, the eustachian tube is formed at the base of the middle ear . The eustachian\u00a0tube links the ear to the throat/pharynx.",
