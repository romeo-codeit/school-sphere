    "explanation": "Given that the terminal potential difference (p.d.) of the cell is reduced to three-quarters of its e.m.f. when a resistor \\( R \\) is connected, we can express this as:\n\\(V = \\frac{3}{4} E\\)\nThe relationship between terminal voltage \\( V \\), e.m.f. \\( E \\), internal resistance \\( r \\), and current \\( I \\) is given by:\n\\(V = E - Ir\\)\nThe current \\( I \\) can be expressed as: \\(I = \\frac{V}{R}\\)\nSubstituting for \\( I \\) in the voltage equation:\n\\(V = E - \\left(\\frac{V}{R}\\right) r\\)\nSubstituting \\( V = \\frac{3}{4} E \\):\n\\(\\frac{3}{4} E = E - \\left(\\frac{\\frac{3}{4} E}{R}\\right) r\\)\nRearranging gives: \\(\\frac{3}{4} E = E - \\frac{3Er}{4R}\\)\nSimplifying: \\(\\frac{3}{4} E - E = -\\frac{3Er}{4R}\\)\nThis leads to: \\(-\\frac{1}{4} E = -\\frac{3Er}{4R}\\)\nDividing both sides by \\( -E \\): \\(\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3r}{4R}\\)\nCross-multiplying results in: \\(R = 3r\\)\nFinally, solving for \\( r \\): \\(r = \\frac{R}{3}\\).",
