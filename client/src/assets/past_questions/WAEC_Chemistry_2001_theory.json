On crystallisation the hepta hydrate crystals MgSO\\(_4\\). 7H\\(_2\\)O known as Epsom salt is obtained. MgO + H\\(_2\\)SO\\(_4\\) -> MgSO\\(_4\\) + H\\(_2\\)O.\n(b)(i) - Industrial effuents -.Human waste. -Human activities\n(ii) During boiling some molecules of water do break up into oxygen and hydrogen, the oxygen then combine with the atmospheric oxygen.\n(iii) Alum (a double salt)\n(c)(i) - It is a greenish yellow gas\n- It is moderately soluble in water\n- It is about 2.5 times denser than air\n-It can be liquefied under pressure\n- It is poisonous.\n(ii) 2 FeCl\\(_2\\) + Cl\\(_2\\) ----> 2FeCI\\(_3\\)\n(iii) Chlorine is preferred to sulphur (IV) oxide in the bleaching of cotton because the bleaching action of SO\\(_2\\) usually does not last since the bleached dye become re-oxidized by atmospheric oxygen to form the original coloured compound. This is not so with chlorine.\n(d) CaOCl\\(_2\\) + 2HCI -> CaCl\\(_2\\) + H\\(_2\\)O + Cl\\(_2\\) from the equation.\n(40 + 16 + 35.5 x 2)g CaOCl\\(_2\\)\u00a0 will produce 22400cm\\(^3\\) of Cl\\(_2\\) at s.t.p.\n127g -> 22400cm\\(^3\\) at temp.\n= 273k and pressure\n= 1.01 x 10\\(^5\\) N/M\\(^{-2}\\); Volume of CaOCl\\(_2\\) at s.t.p.\n\\(\\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1}\\) = \\(\\frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}\\)\n\\(V_2 = \\frac{P_1V_1T_2}{T_1P_2}\\)\n= \\(\\frac{1.20 \\times 10^5 \\times 400 \\times 273}{298 \\times 1.01 \\times 1.05}\\)\n= 435.4cm\\(^3\\)\n127g -> 22400dm\\(^3\\) ;\ny -> 435.4dm\\(^3\\)\ny mass or CaOCl\\(_2\\) = \\(\\frac{435.4}{22400}\\) x 127 = 2.468g",
