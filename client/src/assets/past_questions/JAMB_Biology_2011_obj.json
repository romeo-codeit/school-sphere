    "explanation": "In incomplete dominance,\u00a0neither allele for a trait is completely dominant, resulting in a heterozygous offspring that displays a blended phenotype between the two parent traits.\u00a0For example, crossing a red flower plant with a white flower plant will produce pink flower plants.\u00a0This differs from complete dominance where the dominant allele masks the recessive one, and from codominance where both alleles are expressed.\n(see diagram above)\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Agglutination during blood transfusion occurs when:\n- Red blood cells from the donor have antigens on their surface that are different from the recipient's antigens.\n- The recipient's immune system recognizes these foreign antigens and produces antibodies against them.\n- The antibodies bind to the antigens on the donor's red blood cells, causing them to clump together (agglutinate).\nThis reaction can lead to serious complications, including hemolysis (red blood cell destruction) and even death. To prevent this, blood types are carefully matched before transfusion.\nThe correct answer is option A. contrasting antigens and antibodies.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
