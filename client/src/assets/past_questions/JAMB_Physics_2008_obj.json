    "explanation": "To find the primary current of the step-down transformer, we follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the Power Input:The efficiency (\\( \\eta \\)) of the transformer is given by:\\(\\eta = \\frac{\\text{Power Output}}{\\text{Power Input}} \\times 100\\)Rearranging gives:\\(\\text{Power Input} = \\frac{\\text{Power Output}}{\\eta}\\)\nGiven:- Power Output = 50 W- Efficiency = 80\\% = 0.80\nThus,\\(\\text{Power Input} = \\frac{50 \\, \\text{W}}{0.80} = 62.5 \\, \\text{W}\\)\n2. Calculate the Primary Current:The power input can also be expressed in terms of voltage and current:\\(\\text{Power Input} = V_p \\times I_p\\)Where:- \\( V_p \\) = primary voltage (given as 200 V)- \\( I_p \\) = primary current (what we want to find)\nRearranging gives:\\(\u00a0I_p = \\frac{\\text{Power Input}}{V_p}\\)\nNow substituting the values:\\(I_p = \\frac{62.5 \\, \\text{W}}{200 \\, \\text{V}} = 0.3125 \\, \\text{A}\\)\nThus, the primary current of the transformer is: 0.3125A\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
