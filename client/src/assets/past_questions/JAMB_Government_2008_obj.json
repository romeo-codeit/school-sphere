Benito Mussolini, on the other hand, was the leader of theNational Fascist Partyin Italy. Both parties were central to the establishment of their respective fascist regimes\nHowever, some sources argue that a fascist state can also be considered azero-party system, meaning that political parties are either nonexistent or completely controlled by the ruling authority.
