    "correct_answer": "He received a classical Arabic education, studying the Quran and Arabic linguistics, the basis for an understanding of the Quran and of Islamic law, Hadith and Fiqh. The philosopher Al-Alibi introduced him to mathematics, logic and philosophy. At the age of 17, Ibn Khaldun lost both his parents to an epidemic of the plague, which hit Tunis. At the age of 20, he began his political career at the Chancellery of the Tunisian ruler, Ibn Tafrakin, with the position of Katib al-\u2018alamah, which consisted of writing in fine calligraphy the typical introductory notes of official documents. In 1352, 5 Abu Zaid, the Sultan of Constantine, marched on Tunis, and defeated it. Ibn Khaldun\u2019s thirst for advanced knowledge and a better academic setting soon made him leave this service and migrate to Fez. He was the ambassador of the Sultan of Granada to Pedro the Cruel, the Christian king of Castile in 1363. Although once imprisoned for nearly two years, he was blessed with good luck and traveled extensively at a time when few people could find the means to do so. Soon after his entire family died in a shipwreck, he made the Hajj to Makkah. In 1377, in the short period of five months, he wrote the Muqadimmah (or Prolegomena) while secluded at a palace of Sultan Abu Hamu near Tujin (Enan, 1975). Although he added to his work over the next five years, the whirlwinds of political change and courtly intrigue compelled him to set aside his Prolegomena and move to Cairo, where he became a noted professor, judge and sheikh (manager) of Baybars, the greatest Sufi institution of that age. His final work, an autobiography, has yet to be translated into English. Since Ibn Khaldun\u2019s life was so thoroughly connected to historical events, his theory organically links the realms of ideas and actions. Thus to pose the categories of his thought in the scholastic tradition of Western philosophy (particularly the idealism/ materialism schism) completely fails to deal with the unity of these domains in Ibn Khaldun\u2019s system. The prevalence with which Europeans have compared Ibn Khaldun to Western scholars has led Franz Rosenthal, Ibn Khaldun\u2019s translator and one of the principal Arabist scholars in the United States, to coin the term \u2018forerunner syndrome\u2019 to describe and simultaneously criticize this tendency (Bruce, 1984). Praise, too, can be a means of obscuring the contributions of Ibn Khaldun. In his three volumes Study of History, Arnold Toynbee calls Ibn Khaldun\u2019s philosophy of history \u2018the greatest work of its kind that has ever been created by any mind in any time or place\u2019. For Toynbee, Ibn Khaldun was the \u2018sole point of light\u2019 and \u2018the one outstanding personality\u2019 of Islamic thought, absurd ideas that illustrate centuries of the West\u2019s utter disregard of Islamic intellectual tradition. His cultural context incapacitated Toynbee, but his own system places Ibn Khaldun within the prevailing Western viewpoint that modern history begins with the Renaissance, an assumption that clearly transposes Western historical conditions onto world history. During the same century that Ibn Khaldun lived, there was not one Christian Arabic scholar in Europe (Southern, 1962). Long before Europeans became acquainted with Muslim thought, Turkish scholars delighted in the treasures they found accessible to them. Despite Europes\u2019s ignorance, Europeans \u2018discovered\u2019 the importance of Ibn Khaldun in the nineteenth century, thereby elevating his status from just another \u2018footnote to Islamic historiography\u2026. as the foremost Muslim historian of Ibn Khaldun\u2019. M. Talbi remarked, \u2018It was in Europe that Ibn Khaldun was discovered and the importance of his Mukaddima realized.\u2019 (Bruce 1984). Once the thought of Ibn Khaldun became known in Europe, however, a growing list of admirers appeared, and fawning admiration and inclination toward the appropriation of Ibn Khaldun into a preexisting system of Eurocentric categories accelerated.",

    "correct_answer": "Muhammad was very religious, occasionally taking journeys of devotion to sacred sites near Mecca. On one of his pilgrimages in 610, he was meditating in a cave on Mount Jabal aI-Nour. The Angel Gabriel appeared and relayed the word of God: \u201cRecite in the name of your Lord who creates, creates man from a clot! Recite for your lord is most generous\u2026.\u201d These words became the opening verses of s\u016brah (chapter) 96 of the Qur'an. Most Islamic historians believe Muhammad was initially disturbed by the revelations and that he didn\u2019t reveal them publicly for several years. However, Shi\u2019a tradition states he welcomed the message from the Angel Gabriel and was deeply inspired to share his experience with other potential believers.\nIslamic tradition holds that the first persons to believe were his wife, Khadija and his close friend Abu Bakr (regarded as the successor to Muhammad by Sunni Muslims). Soon, Muhammad began to gather a small following, initially encountering no opposition. Most people in Mecca either ignored him or mocked him as just another prophet. However, when his message condemned idol worship and polytheism, many of Mecca\u2019s tribal leaders began to see Muhammad and his message as a threat. Besides going against long standing beliefs, the condemnation of idol worship had economic consequences for merchants who catered to the thousands of pilgrims who came to Mecca every year. This was especially true for members of Muhammad\u2019s own tribe, the Quraysh, who were the guardians of the Kaaba. Sensing a threat, Mecca\u2019s merchants and leaders offered Muhammad incentives to abandon his preaching, but he refused.\nIncreasingly, the resistance to Muhammed and his followers grew and they were eventually forced to emigrate from Mecca to Medina, a city 260 miles to the north in 622. This event marks the beginning of the Muslim calendar. There Muhammad was instrumental in bringing an end to a civil war raging amongst several of the city\u2019s tribes. Muhammad settled in Medina, building his Muslim community and gradually gathering acceptance and more followers.\nBetween 624 and 628, the Muslims were involved in a series of battles for their survival. In the final major confrontation, The Battle of the Trench and Siege of Medina, Muhammad and his followers prevailed and a treaty was signed. The treaty was broken by the Meccan allies a year later. By now, Muhammad had plenty of forces and the balance of power had shifted away from the Meccan leaders to him. In 630, the Muslim army marched into Mecca, taking the city with minimum casualties. Muhammad gave amnesty to many of the Meccan leaders who had opposed him and pardoned many others. Most of the Meccan population converted to Islam. Muhammad and his followers then proceeded to destroy all of the statues of pagan gods in and around the Kaaba.",

According to the historian Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, al-Tirmidhi wrote this work in 270 AH (884 AH), when he was about sixty years of age, after having gained considerable experience in science and becoming an imam . Manuscripts of this work have been preserved in many cities around the world, as well as in the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan, Oriental Studies Institute named after Abu Raykhan Beruni. \u2015Al-Jami` as-Sahih\u2016 has been repeatedly published as an important source. For instance, it was published in Mitoh 1283 (1866), Cairo in 1292 (1875), and in Beirut in 1980. Several commentaries were written for this work such as \u2015Aridhat al-Ahwathi bi Sharh Sunan al-Tirmidhi\u2016 by Ibn al-Arabi (d. 543H )(1148-49 CE), \u2015Sharh Jaami' al-Tirmidhi\u2016 of which only the last portion of remains \u2013 \u2015Sharh 'Ilal at-Tirmidhi\u2016 by Ibn Rajab, \u2015Commentary on al-Tirmidhi's Hadith Collection\u2016 by al-Zayn al-Iraqi, Footnotes, including explanation and verification, of approximately the first third of the Sunan by Ahmad Muhammad Shakir, \u2015Al-\u02bfUrf al Shadhi Sharh Sunan Al-Tirmidhi\u2016 by Anwar Shah Kashmiri, \u2015Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi Bi Sharh Jami\u02bf Al-Tirmidhi\u2016 by 'Abd al-Rahman al-Mubarkafuri, \u2015Fuyoodh Un Nabi, Sharh Jami Al Tirmidhi\u2016 (in Urdu Language) by 'Allama Mufti Muhammad Arshad ul Qadri' .

The fruitful work of such scholars as Imam al-Bukhari and Imam Muslim, who lived and worked at that time, is of great importance.

Being alarmed at the departure of Muslims, according to the tradition, the Meccans plotted to assassinate him. He instructed his cousin and future son-in-lawAlito sleep in his bed to trick the assassins that he had stayed (and to fight them off in his stead) and secretly slipped away from the town.\u00a0By 622, Muhammad had emigrated to Medina, then known as Yathrib, a large agriculturaloasis.\u00a0Following the emigration, the Meccans seized the properties of the Muslim emigrants in Mecca.The first group ofpaganconverts to Islam in Medina were the clans who had not produced great leaders for themselves but had suffered from warlike leaders from other clans. This was followed by the general acceptance of Islam by thepagan populationof Medina, apart from some exceptions. This was, according toIbn Ishaq, influenced by the conversion to Islam ofSa'd ibn Mua'dh, one of the prominent leaders in Medina.Among the things Muhammad did in order to settle the longstanding grievances among the tribes of Medina was drafting a document known as theConstitution of Medina(date debated), establishing a kind of brotherhood among the eight Medinan tribes andMuslim emigrants from Mecca, which specified the rights and duties of all citizens and the relationship of the different communities in Medina (including that of the Muslim community to other communities specifically the Jews and other \"Peoples of the Book\").\u00a0The community defined in the Constitution of Medina,umma, had a religious outlook but was also shaped by the practical considerations and substantially preserved the legal forms of the oldArab tribes.\u00a0Muhammad's adoption of facing north towardsJerusalemwhen performing the daily prayers (qibla) however need not to necessarily be a borrowing from the Jews as the reports about the direction of prayer before migration to Medina are contradictory and further this direction of prayer was also practiced among other groups inArabia.",
