    "explanation": "Gin is a distilled alcoholic beverage that typically contains about 40% ethanol. To produce gin from wine, the wine must undergo a process called distillation. Distillation involves heating the wine to vaporize the ethanol, which has a lower boiling point than water, and then condensing the vapor to collect the ethanol. This results in a much higher concentration of ethanol in the final product. Fermentation, which is the process by which wine is produced, can only produce ethanol concentrations of up to about 17%. Therefore, distillation is necessary to increase the ethanol content of the wine to the level required for gin.",
