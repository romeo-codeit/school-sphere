For example, \"It will take some time to finish the project.\"Sometime: This is a single word that functions as an adverb. It refers to an unspecified point in time, either in the past or future. For example, \"Let's meet sometime next week.\"\nNow, for the sentence \"I saw him again........last week,\" the correct answer is D.sometime.
