Remove the prism.\nDraw a normal NMP to meet AB and\u00a0DC at M and P respectively such that |AM|\u00a0=|DP| = 2.0cm.\nTrace the ray PQ with two pins, P\\(_{1}\\), and P\\(_{2}\\), at P and Q respectively such that angle MPQ\u00a0= i = 5\u00ba.\nReplace the prism on its outline. Trace the emergent ray with two other pins P\\(_{3}\\)\u00a0and P\\(_{4}\\)\u00a0such that they lie in a straight line with P\\(_{2}\\)\u00a0and the image of P\\(_{1}\\)\u00a0viewed through the glass prism.\nMeasure and record \\(\\theta\\), the angle between the emergent ray and the face AB of the glass prism.\nEvaluate cos \\(\\theta\\) and sin i.\nRepeat the procedure for four other values of i= 10\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 20\u00b0, and 25\u00b0. Tabulate your readings.\nPlot a graph of cos \\(\\theta\\) on the vertical axis\u00a0against sin i on the horizontal axis.\nDetermine the slope of the graph.\nState two precautions taken to ensure accurate results.\u00a0 Attach your traces to your answer booklet\n\n(b)i.\u00a0State the laws of refraction of light.\nii.\u00a0Explain what is meant by the statement the refractive index of a material is 1.65.",
