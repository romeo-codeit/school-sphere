    "answer_url": "https://myschool.ng/classroom/chemistry/27464?exam_type=jamb&type=obj&page=254",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "To obtain pure water from a mixture of sand, water, and methanoic acid, we need to consider the properties of each component:\n- Sand is insoluble in water and can be removed by filtration.\n- Methanoic acid (formic acid) is a volatile liquid that can be separated from water by distillation.\n- Water is the desired product.\nConsidering these properties, the correct answer is: Option D. (Filtration followed by distillation)\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n1. Filtration: Remove the sand from the mixture by passing it through a filter paper.\n2. Distillation: Distill the resulting liquid mixture to separate the methanoic acid from the water. Since water\u00a0has a lower boiling point than methanoic acid, it will vapourize and condense first, allowing you to collect the pure water.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
