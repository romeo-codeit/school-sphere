    "explanation": "The phrase\"fill the memory, rule the heart, and guide the feet\"is usingmetaphorbecause it's describing the impact of the book in terms ofaction verbs(\"fill,\" \"rule,\" and \"guide\") applied to non-literal aspects of the mind, emotions\u00a0and actions.Memory,heartandfeetare being symbolically used to represent the mind, emotions, and actions, respectively, rather than their literal meanings. This metaphor suggests that the book should influence the reader's thoughts (memory), feelings (heart), and actions (feet).\nA refrain is a repeated line or phrase in a song or poem, but here, there is no repetition.\u00a0Synecdoche is a figure of speech where a part is used to represent the whole (or vice versa). This doesn't apply here, as the \"memory\", \"heart\" and \"feet\" are symbolic representations of our minds, emotions and actions and are not part of a whole.",
