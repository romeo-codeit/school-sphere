    "correct_answer": "(a)(i)Malware, short for \"malicious software,\" refers to any software or code specifically designed to harm, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or user data. Malware is created with malicious intent and can take various forms, often causing harm to computers, stealing sensitive information, or compromising system integrity. It's a broad category that encompasses a range of malicious software types, each with its own distinct behavior and purpose.(ii)Common types of malware include viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, adware, ransomware, and more.Here's a brief overview of some common types of malware:- Viruses: Viruses are malicious programs that attach themselves to legitimate files or software and replicate when the infected file is executed. They can spread across systems and cause damage by corrupting or deleting files, as well as by spreading to other devices.- Worms: Worms are self-replicating malware that spread through computer networks without requiring user interaction. They exploit vulnerabilities to automatically infect and spread to other systems, often causing network congestion and slowdowns.- Trojans: Trojans, named after the deceptive Trojan Horse from Greek mythology, appear to be legitimate software but contain hidden malicious functions. They can create backdoors, steal information, or perform other harmful actions.- Spyware: Spyware is designed to collect information from a user's device without their knowledge. It can track browsing habits, capture keystrokes, record personal information, and relay this data to malicious actors.- Adware: Adware displays unwanted advertisements to users, often in the form of pop-ups or banners. While not always harmful, adware can be intrusive and negatively affect the user experience.- Ransomware: Ransomware encrypts a user's files or entire system and demands payment (a ransom) in exchange for the decryption key. It can render data inaccessible until the ransom is paid, though there's no guarantee of receiving the decryption key even after payment.- Botnets: Botnets are networks of compromised computers, often controlled remotely by a single entity, which can be used for various malicious activities, such as launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or sending spam.- Rootkits: Rootkits are designed to gain unauthorized access to a computer system and conceal their presence from detection by modifying system components. They often grant control of the system to attackers.- Keyloggers: Keyloggers capture keystrokes on a compromised system, potentially recording sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers.- Malvertising: Malvertising involves spreading malware through online advertisements. Attackers inject malicious code into legitimate ads, and when users click on these ads, they can inadvertently download and install malware.- Fileless Malware: This type of malware doesn't rely on traditional files but resides in a system's memory or uses legitimate system tools to carry out malicious activities. This makes it harder to detect and remove.Malware can be introduced through various means, including infected email attachments, malicious downloads, compromised websites, and social engineering tactics. Protecting against malware involves using security software, regularly updating software and operating systems, practicing safe browsing habits, being cautious with email attachments, and regularly backing up important data.\n(b)- The computer starts to run slowly. Malware can slow down the computer by consuming resources, such as CPU time and memory.- The computer crashes or freezes. Malware can cause computers to crash or freeze by overloading it or by corrupting system files.- One sees new programs or toolbars on the computer. Malware can install new programs or toolbars on the computer without one's knowledge.- One sees pop-up ads. Malware can display pop-up ads on the computer, even if one have ad blockers installed.5. The homepage changes. Malware can change the homepage to a website that one did not choose.6. The search results are different. Malware can change the search results to show websites that are not relevant to the search terms.7. one receives emails from people one doesn't know.

    "answer_url": "https://myschool.ng/classroom/data-processing/69812?exam_type=waec&type=theory&page=8",
    "correct_answer": "(a)In the context of a database management system (DBMS), fragmentation and replication are two strategies used to distribute and manage data across multiple locations or nodes in a distributed database environment. Here are more than one difference between fragmentation and replication:- Definition and Purpose:Fragmentation: Fragmentation involves breaking a database into smaller subsets or fragments that are stored on different nodes. Each fragment may contain a portion of the data or a subset of the database schema. The goal is to divide the data to improve data distribution, access efficiency, and performance.Replication: Replication involves creating and maintaining duplicate copies of the entire database or portions of it on different nodes. The purpose is to enhance data availability, fault tolerance, and read performance by allowing multiple nodes to access the same data.- Data Distribution:Fragmentation: Fragmentation divides the data horizontally (rows) or vertically (columns) among different nodes. Different fragments may contain different rows or columns, reducing the amount of data stored on each node.Replication: Replication involves creating identical copies of the same data on multiple nodes. All replicated copies contain the same data, which can improve data availability and reduce data access latency.- Data Consistency:Fragmentation: Fragmentation may lead to data consistency challenges, especially if updates affect data distributed across multiple fragments. Synchronization mechanisms are needed to ensure consistency.Replication: Replication can enhance data consistency by ensuring that the same data exists on multiple nodes. However, maintaining consistency across replicas requires careful synchronization mechanisms.- Write Operations:Fragmentation: Fragmentation may require coordination among nodes for write operations that affect data distributed across different fragments. This coordination can introduce overhead and affect performance.Replication: Write operations can be performed on any replica, potentially improving write performance by distributing the load. However, maintaining consistency among replicas requires synchronization mechanisms.- Read Operations:Fragmentation: Fragmentation can impact read performance if a query requires data from multiple fragments, as the DBMS needs to gather data from different nodes.Replication: Replication can enhance read performance by allowing queries to be served from multiple replicas, reducing data access latency.- Data Storage:Fragmentation: Fragmented data may be stored on different nodes based on data distribution policies. Nodes may hold different portions of the schema.Replication: Replicated data is stored on multiple nodes, with each node having a complete copy of the data or a subset of it.- Data Access Patterns:Fragmentation: Fragmentation aims to optimize data access patterns for specific use cases, focusing on distributing data efficiently.Replication: Replication focuses on improving data availability and accessibility, ensuring that data can be accessed from multiple nodes.Both fragmentation and replication serve distinct purposes in a distributed database environment, and the choice between these strategies depends on factors such as data access patterns, performance goals, consistency requirements, and fault tolerance needs",
    "explanation": "(a)In the context of a database management system (DBMS), fragmentation and replication are two strategies used to distribute and manage data across multiple locations or nodes in a distributed database environment. Here are more than one difference between fragmentation and replication:- Definition and Purpose:Fragmentation: Fragmentation involves breaking a database into smaller subsets or fragments that are stored on different nodes. Each fragment may contain a portion of the data or a subset of the database schema. The goal is to divide the data to improve data distribution, access efficiency, and performance.Replication: Replication involves creating and maintaining duplicate copies of the entire database or portions of it on different nodes. The purpose is to enhance data availability, fault tolerance, and read performance by allowing multiple nodes to access the same data.- Data Distribution:Fragmentation: Fragmentation divides the data horizontally (rows) or vertically (columns) among different nodes. Different fragments may contain different rows or columns, reducing the amount of data stored on each node.Replication: Replication involves creating identical copies of the same data on multiple nodes. All replicated copies contain the same data, which can improve data availability and reduce data access latency.- Data Consistency:Fragmentation: Fragmentation may lead to data consistency challenges, especially if updates affect data distributed across multiple fragments.
