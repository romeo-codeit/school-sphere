Lewis\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "In poetry, metre (Commonwealth English) or meter (American English) is the basic rhythmic structure of a verse or lines in verse. Many traditional verse forms prescribe a specific verse metre, or a certain set of metres alternating in a particular order. The study and the actual use of metres and forms of versification are both known as prosody. (Within linguistics, \"prosody\" is used in a more general sense that includes not only poetic metre but also the rhythmic aspects of prose, whether formal or informal, that vary from language to language, and sometimes between poetic traditions. Meter is a stressed and unstressed syllabic pattern in a verse, or within the lines of a poem. Stressed syllables tend to be longer, and unstressed shorter. In simple language, meter is a poetic device that serves as a linguistic sound pattern for the verses, as it gives poetry a rhythmical and melodious sound. For instance, if you read a poem aloud, and it produces regular sound patterns, then this poem would be a metered or measured poem. English poetry employs five basic meters, including:\n\u2022 Iambic meter (unstressed/stressed)\n\u2022 Trochaic meter (stressed/unstressed)\n\u2022 Spondaic meter, (stressed/stressed)\n\u2022 Anapestic meter (unstressed/unstressed/ stressed)\n\u2022 Dactylic meter (stressed/unstressed/unstressed)\nMeter has two subdivisions: qualitative meter, and quantitative meter.\nQualitative Meter\nQualitative meter contains stressed syllables with regular intervals, such as iambic pentameter containing even numbered syllables. Quantitative Meter Quantitative meter, however, is based on syllabic weight, and not stressed pattern,s such as dactylic hexameters of classical Greek and classical Latin. However, classical Arabic and Sanskrit also have used this meter. Poets like Virgil used quantitative meter in Aeneid, and Homer used it in Iliad.\nShort Examples of Meter; People become what they believe.\n(Trochaic meter)-Those who can dream it, they really can achieve it.\n(Dactylic/Spondaic)-Don\u2019t search faults. Find remedies.\n(Iambic meter)-When you give and accept gratefully, you feel blessed.\n(Anapestic meter)-The safest place on planet earth.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The protagonist and main character of Native Son, Bigger is the focus of the novel and the embodiment of its main theme\u2014the effect of racism on the psychological state of its black victims. As a twenty-year-old black man cramped in a South Side apartment with his family, Bigger has lived a life defined by the fear and anger he feels toward whites for as long as he can remember. Bigger is limited by the fact that he has only completed the eighth grade, and by the racist real estate practices that force him to live in poverty. Furthermore, he is subjected to endless bombardment from a popular culture that portrays whites as sophisticated and blacks as either subservient or savage. Indeed, racism has severely curtailed Bigger\u2019s prospects in life and even his very conception of himself. He is ashamed of his family\u2019s poverty and afraid of the whites who control his life\u2014feelings he works hard to keep hidden, even from himself. When these feelings overwhelm him, he reacts with violence. Bigger commits crimes with his friends\u2014though only against other blacks, as the group is too frightened to rob a white man\u2014but his own violence is often directed at these friends as well. Bigger feels little guilt after he accidentally kills Mary due to fear. But later on, he feels for the first time as though his life actually has meaning. Mary\u2019s murder makes him believe that he has the power to assert himself against whites. Wright goes out of his way to emphasize that Bigger is not a conventional hero, as his brutality and capacity for violence are extremely disturbing, especially in graphic scenes such as the one in which he decapitates Mary\u2019s corpse in order to stuff it into the furnace. Wright does not present Bigger as a hero to admire, but as a frightening and upsetting figure created by racism. Indeed, Wright\u2019s point is that Bigger becomes a brutal killer precisely because the dominant white culture fears that he will become a brutal killer. By confirming whites\u2019 fears, Bigger contributes to the cycle of racism in America. Only after he meets Max and learns to talk through his problems does Bigger begin to redeem himself, recognizing whites as individuals for the first time and realizing the extent to which he has been stunted by racism. Bigger\u2019s progress is cut short, however, by his execution\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
