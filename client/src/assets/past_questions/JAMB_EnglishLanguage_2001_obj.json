Therefore, the option that has a word different from the one in capital letters should be the correct answer.\nIn the sentence, \"They FLEW to Abuja,\" the question that best fits is \"Did they go to Abuja by road?\"\nIt shows that the responder to the question is trying to correct the fact that they did not go by road but FLEW to Abuja.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
