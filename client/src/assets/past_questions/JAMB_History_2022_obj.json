Unfortunately, the League failed miserably in its intended goal: to prevent another world war from happening (WW2 broke out only two decades later).\nThe idea was for the League of Nations to prevent wars through disarmament, collective security, and negotiation. It was also involved in other issues such as drug trafficking, arms trade, and global health. Although the League disbanded during WW2, it was replaced with the United Nations, which is still going strong today.",
