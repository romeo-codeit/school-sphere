    "explanation": "Classical mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the motion of macroscopic objects. It is based on the principles of Newton's laws of motion and is not considered to be part of elementary modern physics.The other three options, quantum mechanics, special relativity, and nuclear physics, are all considered to be part of elementary modern physics because they deal with the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Adhesive surfaces are surfaces that are wetted by water. This means that the water molecules are attracted to the wood surface, and they spread out to form a thin layer in order to maximize their contact with the surface. The adhesive forces between the water molecules and the wood surface are stronger than the cohesive forces between the water molecules, resulting in a thin layer.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "When a negatively charged rod is brought close to a metal sphere, the free electrons in the sphere are repelled from the rod and move to the other end of the sphere. This creates a region of positive charge on the side of the sphere closest to the rod, and a region of negative charge on the opposite side. The process of charge distribution stops when the net force on the free electrons inside the metal is equal to zero.If the sphere is then earthed, the free electrons will flow from the sphere to the ground, leaving the sphere with a net positive charge.\nThere is an explanation video availablebelow.",
