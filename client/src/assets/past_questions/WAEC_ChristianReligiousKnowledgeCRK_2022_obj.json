    "explanation": "The name Jedidiah was given to Solomon by the prophet Nathan, and it carries a significant meaning. The event is recorded in 2 Samuel 12:24-25. Here's a brief explanation:\nAfter King David committed adultery with Bathsheba and arranged for her husband Uriah to be killed, the prophet Nathan confronted David with his sin. As a consequence of David's actions, the child born to him and Bathsheba became ill and eventually died.\nAfter the child's death, Solomon was born later, and the name Jedidiah (\"beloved of the Lord\") was given to him by the prophet Nathan (2 Samuel 12:24-25). The naming of Solomon as Jedidiah served as a reminder of God's love and grace even in the midst of the consequences of David's wrongdoing. It emphasizes that God had a special and affectionate purpose for Solomon, who would later become known for his wisdom and play a crucial role in the construction of the temple in Jerusalem.",
